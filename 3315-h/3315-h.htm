    <h2>
      Foreword
    </h2>
    <p>
      So many inquiries have been made as to exactly where, and what is the
      "Mother Lode"!
    </p>
    <p>
      The geologist and the historian agree as to its location and composition,
      but the old miners and "sojourners" of the vanished golden era give
      strangely different versions of it. Some of these are here set down, if
      not all for your enlightenment at least, I hope, for your entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, after all, the principal aim of these tales of the old days in
      California, that are gone "for good." Mark Twain says in his preface to
      "Roughing It" that there is a great deal of information in his work which
      he regrets very much but which really could not be helped, as "information
      seems to stew out of me naturally, like the precious ottar of roses out of
      the otter"!
    </p>
    <p>
      These stories make no such particular claim! They are merely historical
      fragments of their everyday life, gathered from a passing generation
      before they shall be finally lost. Each one is based upon truth.
      Somewhere, sometime, some place, certain characters lived the scenes and
      actions here described.
    </p>
    <p>
      The title "Mother Lode" has been used in its broader sense as exemplifying
      the source of all gold in California, and the life which arose from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mining engineer said: "The Mother Lode runs south from El Dorado
      County to the lower boundary of Mariposa County. It stretches past the
      towns of Sutter Creek, Jackson, San Andreas, Angel's Camp and the road to
      Yosemite far down below Coulterville. The lode begins suddenly and ends as
      suddenly, and though we have searched up and down the state we have never
      been able to pick it up again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has it any relation to the Comstock Lode?" was asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None whatever. Curiously enough, in Nevada City and vicinity it would
      appear that at one time in the earth's making, a great fissure opened in
      forming California and a wedge of Nevada mining country was pushed into
      it. North of there the California stratas begin again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it was always my belief that these localities were on the Mother
      Lode, as well as the Georgetown and Auburn country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many persons are apparently under that impression, but the geological
      surveys of the government place it in the exact location I have given
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Old Miner, '49er," said: "We hunted most all o' our lives, lookin'
      for her! We called her the Mother Lode, because we thought that all the
      gold in the state must a' come from her an' washed down the rivers onto
      the bars where we found it. We thought she'd be pure gold, an' a hundred
      feet wide an' go on, world without end. We looked, an' looked, an' after
      quartz minin' come in, we dug an' dug, but we never found the old girl
      exceptin' here an' there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joe Dance, that old prospector that died last year, he lost his mind
      lookin' for the big lode. Made some rich strikes in his day, Joe did, but
      he never could stop to work 'em. He was always waitin' for the mother of
      'em all, he said, who'd put him on the road to the heart a' molten gold in
      the middle a' the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We old fellows tramped all the way through the hills with only a burro
      for company most a' the time, an' you'll ride down a broad paved way,
      soon, in your automobile. You'll go in days, where it took us months, an'
      some brainy young engineer will locate the old girl, most likely, in
      new-fangled ways that were unknown in our time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the world whirls fast, now-a-days. Guess they'll need all the gold
      in the old girl's lap to keep on greasin' the machinery. I take off my hat
      to this generation. I hope they'll find it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hittell says: "The Mother Lode is one of the most extraordinary
      metalliferous veins in the world. Gold-bearing lodes usually range only
      five or six miles, but this can be traced for more than sixty. The rock is
      a hard and white quartz, rich in very fine particles of gold, and the vein
      varies in width from a foot to thirty feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are in some portions of its course side branches or companion
      veins, as they are sometimes called, making the total width nearly one
      hundred feet. Nor is the direction of the lode always in a straight line.
      Though usually found within half a mile of what may be considered its
      normal course, it is sometimes found as far as two or three miles from it,
      and there are cases of other lodes (three, in all) entirely distinct,
      which in some instances approach so close as to be confounded with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      There are numerous mines along the whole length of the lode, famous for
      having yielded their millions. One quartz ledge is said to have yielded
      for a long time, two-thirds gold. They say of the Morgan Mine, at Carson's
      Creek near Melones, "It appeared to be rich beyond parallel. On one
      occasion $110,000.00 worth of gold was thrown down at a single blast."
    </p>
    <p>
      Many expeditions were made in search of the fabled Great Lode but all
      attempts were vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The old spread-eagle judge said: "Yes, sir; the Mother Lode dips up in a
      bit of a circle with no beginning and no end, in the western foothills of
      the Sierra Mountains. Down about Melones, and Sonora, and Angel's Camp it
      goes, and through Table Mountain, and under Jackass Hill. It comes north,
      and north, past Coloma, and Auburn, to Nevada City and then it
      disappears."
    </p>
    <p>
      I remembered the engineer's statement, but was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the haunt of Harte, and Twain, and Canfield in the north; it was
      the bank of such men as Hopkins, Crocker, Huntington and Stanford; the
      foundation of one of the greatest states in the Union, the Mother Lode,
      the Mother of Gold!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Child, my old eyes have watched it spread for nearly ninety years&mdash;the
      power of gold, and of the men who came to seek it, The influence of gold
      controlled by the human intellect. I am old and tired and soon I shall
      sleep, but the old see clearly, too clearly, that which they are leaving,
      and that to which they pass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thus, facing the stars, we go out amongst them into darkness'," I
      quoted, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to darkness, but to eternal light, to rise again from the Mother Lode
      to mingle in the busy lives of men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Who maketh His messengers with two, and three, and four pairs of
      wings'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. To be born again, and yet again. The real mother-vein of gold
      was imbued in the men shaped by the life of the frontier. It was the
      cornerstone of great fortunes, of families, of enterprises, of
      achievements which are peculiarly California's own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the clearing house and open sesame of the vast trade of the Orient
      which is just coming into being; the foundation for the bridge of gold
      which shall reach across the seas; a fit monument to posterity which shall
      be erected with all the lightness and grace and stability of the present
      cultured generations, born with their feet in the flowers grown from the
      mother-gold of decent manhood and glorious womanhood&mdash;the precious
      metals of the spirit, unalloyed and unafraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are the true Mother Lode, the bourne of the seekers of gold,
      greater, far, than the crazed brains of the old prospectors had the power
      to conceive. A further-reaching, broader arc than the most wondrous
      rainbow of their imaginings born of dreams, and built of hunger and
      despair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So shall we find, at last, the Mother Lode, the virginity of the essence
      of creation, the beginning and the end. The curve of the circle which is
      unchanging, insoluble, omniscient; which shall return to that which
      created it; which is all; which is God!"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'49"

     "We have worked our claims,
     We have spent our gold,
           Our barks are astrand on the bars;
     We are battered and old,
     Yet at night we behold
           Outcroppings of gold in the stars.

     Where the rabbits play,
     Where the quail all day
          Pipe on the chaparral hill;
     A few more days,
     And the last of us lays
           His pick aside and is still.

     We are wreck and stray,
     We are cast away,
           Poor battered old hulks and spars!
     But we hope and pray,
     On the judgment Day,
           We shall strike it, up in the stars.

     &mdash;Joaquin Miller.

      One Sunday in Stinson's Bar
    </h2>
    <p>
      I
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "On that broad stage of empire won,
     Whose footlights were the setting sun;
     Whose flats a distant background rose
     In trackless peaks of endless snows;
     Here genius bows, and talent waits
     To copy that but One creates."

     &mdash;Bret Harte.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now-a-days when you want to go from San Francisco to the Sierra Nevada
      country you step into your perfectly good Packard (or whatever it is&mdash;all
      the way down to a motorcycle side car), and you ferry across the bay and
      the straits, and if the motor-cop isn't around, you come shooting up the
      highway forty miles an hour, and at the end of a glorious five-hour run
      you are there.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early fifties&mdash;when there was less to see, too&mdash;you took
      more time to it. You came to Sacramento on the river boat. Then if you
      were rich, you bought a horse or a mule and rode for the rest of your
      journey. If you were poor, or thrifty perhaps, you walked, or tried to get
      a ride on one of the ox-freight teams which plied their way across Haggin
      Grant to Auburn and Dutch Flat, or to Folsom and Coloma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later a railway was built as far as Auburn station, then situated at a
      point three miles east of Loomis which was at that time called Pino.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing remains of Auburn station. But the road bed of the old railway is
      still to be found in certain wooded tracts which have not given way to the
      fruit ranches; and the highway from Fair Oaks into Folsom follows the old
      cuts and grades for several miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days preceding and immediately following the discovery of gold in
      California, building was very difficult. Every stick of lumber in my
      grandfather's house came by ship "around the Horn," and the fruit trees
      grape vines, flowers, even bees, for his lovely garden: were all sent from
      Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the smaller settlements there was seldom more than one large building
      which could be used for social purposes, and this was often the card room
      or bar room in connection with the hotel of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here is the tale that was told of one Sunday in Stinson's bar room, in
      the late '50s at Auburn Station:
    </p>
    <p>
      They tried to give a ball once a year at Stinson's. Persons came to it
      from 30 miles about, particularly if they were women, and every woman
      divided each dance among four men. When a man invited a lady to come to a
      dance, in many instances he insisted upon the privilege of buying her a
      silken gown and slippers to wear, and this was not considered unusual, nor
      was she in any way obligated to him for it. There were so few "ladies"
      that they were treated as little short of divinities.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Saturday night there had been no dance, and the men at Gentleman
      Jack's table at Stinson's had played "three-card monte" on through the
      dawn and the sunrise, and into broad daylight. The door was pushed open,
      letting in a rush of cool, sweet air which guttered the candles set in old
      bottles, and drove the heavy fog of tobacco smoke toward the blackened
      ceiling. A voice boomed forth:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, now, gentlemen. Two ladies have come with posies in tall silver
      vases and a white altar cloth for this table. The preacher's coming over
      from Folsom, and there will be church held here in one hour. He's a busy
      man today. An infant will be given a license to travel the long and
      uncertain road to heaven, and a pair of happy lovers will be made one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One&mdash;unhappy pair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's William Duncan. He's intoxicated again," drawled Gentleman Jack,
      stretching his graceful length and smiling at a long, aristocratic figure
      crouched over a small table in a corner. "His last strike turned out to be
      only a small pocket, and so he drowns his woes in liquor, as usual." He
      bowed to his recent card partners. "Gentlemen, I am sincerely sorry for
      your losses this night. I shall sleep an hour before the holy man
      arrives." He sauntered out, stuffing a buckskin bag of gold dust into his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There lies my pocket&mdash;in his pocket," muttered Duncan. "No, Stinson"
      raising his voice authoritatively, "I shall not go out. It is my desire to
      pray for my sins today * * * and there has a letter come from overseas
      which I must read&mdash;if I can. If I can&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour the room was cleared of smoke, greasy cards, poker chips and
      empty bottles. The bar was in a small room apart. The poker table,
      supplemented with a box, was covered with a handsome altar cloth flanked
      by huge silver candlesticks and vases which had been carried across the
      plains. Every individual in the community came to church and stayed
      afterward for the christening. At least twenty men expressed a wish to be
      god-father to the baby and the proud mother accepted all offers. When the
      christening was over, William Duncan lurched to his feet, his high-bred
      face full of tenderness, his long-fingered, fine grained hands poised over
      the rosy child, while he quoted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "May time who sheds his blight o'er all, And daily dooms some joy to
      death. O'er thee let years so gently fall, They shall not crush one flower
      beneath!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, 'here comes the bride!' 'All the world's a stage!' Let us on with the
      next scene," and he reeled back to his little table in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kissing and congratulations after the wedding were interrupted by the
      shouts of a man on horseback, and riding hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's the minister? Send for Doc Miller! That beast of a Mexican horse
      thief&mdash;he' shot Jim Muldoon down at Dolton's Bar. Jim caught he's
      stealing his horse and I'm afraid the dirty greaser's killed him. We got
      'im, though, before he skipped. Somebody go down to Rattlesnake for Doc
      Miller. They're bringing 'em both here."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Doc Miller saw Muldoon stretched on the barroom table, the same table
      which a few minutes before had served as an altar he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will be gone in half an hour," he said. The men standing about began
      taking off their hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to write home," whispered Muldoon. The young mother handed her
      baby to its father and seizing pencil and paper, ran forward. The minister
      opened his prayer book at the service for the dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      When that service had been read, and what had been Muldoon carried away to
      be made ready for the last sleep, only the minister and the tall
      Englishman were left in the bar-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the midst of life we are in death," muttered Duncan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," rebuked the other "so live well the life which the Lord, thy God,
      hath provided thee." Will Duncan laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too late, Man-o'-God! There is no place in the world for a younger
      son." The minister had not heard. He sprang toward the open window,
      calling:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait! It is written&mdash;'Thou shalt not kill!' Bring him in, like just
      and honest men, for a hearing. He may be a horse thief and a murderer but
      you shall take the rope from his neck and he shall speak in his own
      defense before he goes to his Maker."
    </p>
    <p>
      So a hearing was given (although grudgingly, and with audible grumbling)
      by the friends of Muldoon across the table which had so lately been his
      bier, but in the end they took the Mexican out for the short-cut to
      retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later, around the same table was solemnized the funeral service
      of Jim Muldoon. The minister would not return for six weeks. It must be
      held at once. Gentleman Jack gave a suit of finest black broadcloth for a
      shroud, and the little bride, keeping one flower from her wedding bouquet,
      placed the rest in the dead man's hands. She kissed him softly on his
      forehead, whispering through her tears. "For the ones at home who loved
      you," and stood watching as six men carried him away to the tiny cemetery
      under the trees on a hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vesper services were over and the weary minister and his congregation had
      gone before Duncan found courage to open and read his letter. His elder
      brother, heir to the title and great houses and landed estates of his
      family, had been killed in the hunting field and he, being next in line,
      was to come home to succeed to the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, William&mdash;Duncan&mdash;Claibourne&mdash;Earl of&mdash;but no, his
      family name had never been told in California.
    </p>
    <p>
      Portions of the services he had heard that day drifted through his mind:
      "Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he
      shall not enter therein. * * * We do sign him with the sign of the cross
      in token hereafter that he shall manfully fight against the sin, the
      world, and the devil; and to continue Christ's faithful soldier unto his
      life's end." So, the child starting on his earthly journey with the
      minister's blessing and the backing of twenty god-fathers!
    </p>
    <p>
      The holy old church service which he had heard at home in stately English
      cathedrals&mdash;the nuggets in the contribution plate&mdash;the radiant
      bride who had come across the plains to hear "Dearly Beloved, We are
      gathered together," standing beside the man she loved. The service for the
      dying: "When we shall have served thee in our generation we may be
      gathered unto our Fathers, having the testimony of a good conscience, the
      confidence of a certain faith, in favor with Thee our God, and in perfect
      charity with the world." So, Jim Muldoon, cut down before his time, and
      his slayer out there in the darkness on the end of a rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dying candle picked out in flame a withered cabbage rose under the
      table; a baby's mitten, the letter written for the man who had died, the
      Mexican's sombrero on a chair, the gilt sun and moon and stars on the
      glass face of the grandfather clock by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duncan's head fell forward in his clasped arms on the table, and in his
      dreams he heard the huntsman's silver horn from across the seas calling
      him home to carry on the destiny of the ancient and honorable name which
      was his. His "strike of pay ore" in his "land of gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      The candle wick in a shallow pool of tallow flared high, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old clock chimed twelve.

    <h2>
      The Tom Bell Stronghold
    </h2>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "You smile, O poet, and what do you?
     You lean from your window and watch life's column
     Trampling and struggling through dust and dew,
     Filled with its purposes grave and solemn;
     An act, a gesture, a face&mdash;who knows?
     And you pluck from your bosom the verse that grows,
     And down it flies like my red, red rose,
     And you sit and dream as away it goes,
     And think that your duty is done&mdash;now, don't you?"

     &mdash;Bret Harte.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the early days it was called the Mountaineer House. Now it is
      colloquially known as the "stone house," and has for sixty years been the
      home of the Owen King family. It is surrounded today by one of the most
      beautiful orchards in the foothills. Wide verandahs of the native gray
      granite to match the old house itself have been added. It is electrically
      lighted and furnace heated, modern in every way, yet still the romance of
      former times seems to cling to its sturdy old walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that remain unchanged are three huge trees flanking the highway in
      front. What tales they could tell, if they would, of what passed by the
      junction of two roads beneath them. Of the long and weary caravans from
      across the plains crawling up from the bridge at Whiskey Bar, below
      Rattlesnake, glad that their six months' struggle was nearly over: of
      horsemen on beautiful Spanish horses riding furiously, whither no one knew
      nor dared ask; of dark deeds in the old stone house below, that was so
      inscrutably quiet by day and so mysteriously alive by night; of ghastly
      doings by the Tom Bell gang which ranged all the way from the Oregon
      border to the southern lakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They will never tell all they know&mdash;these big old trees&mdash;of
      those who went in by the door and "came out by the cellar" of Tom Bell's
      stronghold. In the end the place fell, in the war between order and
      lawlessness and, as the pessimists love to assert, a woman, as usual, was
      the cause of it. The tale is told:
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa Phillips sat in the Mountaineer House strumming a Spanish guitar, and
      singing,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 "There's a turned down page, as some writer says, in every human life,
 A hidden story of happier days, of peace amidst the strife.
 A folded down leaf which the world knows not. A love dream rudely crushed,
 The sight of a face that is not forgot. Although the voice be hushed."
</pre>
    <p>
      She rose and stood at a window, holding the dusty curtain aside with one
      white hand and peering cautiously forth into the dusk. A horse was
      galloping up the Folsom road. The horseman was near&mdash;was under the
      trees in front&mdash;was past&mdash;and gone down the river road without
      slackening his animal's rapid gait.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does not stop at the Mountaineer House these days," said Tom Bell's
      sneering voice at her elbow. "There is a new actress at the opera house in
      Rattlesnake."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman's dark eyes flashed, but she answered evenly enough:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does not stop, the handsome Dick, so you, senor, have not the cause to
      be jealous. Is it not so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cause? Why, you Spanish jade, you've never been the same to me since
      Rattlesnake Dick came prowling back from Shasta county to his old haunts
      in Placer." Rosa's thin, red lips curled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Senor, I am what it pleases me to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Jack Phillips permits you to be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her slender shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wearies me. Life&mdash;this place&mdash;wearies me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and I weary you, too&mdash;now. Plain as day, it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Phillips woman smiled (she seldom laughed) and there was only cruelty
      in her smile&mdash;no kindliness, no womanly softness of any sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, soon there will be no 'you.' The night is coming and there
      will be no sunrise."
    </p>
    <p>
      A man dismounted at the gate and led his horse past the window to the
      stables in the cellar. He walked with a curious, halting pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Jim Driscoll back already. Must bring news," said Bell, leaving
      her hurriedly, and so neglecting to ask the meaning of her cryptic remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa slipped in behind the bar, late that evening, beautifully gowned, and
      with her dark hair dressed high. Her vivid face glowed like a scarlet
      poppy and was bright with smiles. Three or four men in the crowded
      bar-room rose to their feet and drank to her bright eyes and strolled
      across to the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soon now," she whispered, "I shall sweep out the lights. Those two who
      have just entered&mdash;who are they?" She went across the room to the
      newcomers. "The senors may pay me for the drinks, if they desire," she
      said to them, meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "La Rosita shall take what pleases her," one of them laughed. Among the
      handful of coins and small nuggets he brought from his pocket was a bullet
      strung on a bit of dirty twine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! a love token, senor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, from the throat of Betsy Jane" (a term often used for a rifle).
    </p>
    <p>
      "In twenty minutes, my friends, there will be opened a chute into
      purgatory for all who are in this bar room. Your 'love token' names you
      Senor Bell's men. Before then you will seek the rear of the room&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She drifted away from them to pause at a small table where sat a young man
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, pretty fellow, you are new in California?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I landed in San Francisco only ten days ago." He was new indeed, or
      he would have realized the danger of telling his business to the first
      person who asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go far, senor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not now. I have come far, but my journey is near to a very happy ending."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I have come to marry Miss Elena Ashley, at Auburn, to whom I have
      been long betrothed."
    </p>
    <p>
      She tapped her white teeth with her fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you linger at Mountaineer House?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horses are expensive, and I am not rich. I walked. I was tired. I saw you
      in your garden, and you are very beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa's capricious vanity was touched. The whim seized her to save this
      exuberant young bridegroom from the fate before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you see that peddler&mdash;old Rosenthal&mdash;close to the bar? He
      brought in a large and rich pack tonight. It lies in the next room. Do you
      go there at once. I will come soon, and together we will select a gift for
      your bride. Go quickly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed again behind the bar. Jack Phillips was at one end, lame Jim
      Driscoll at the other, Tom Bell in the middle. Rosa paused near a
      branching candelabra which had once graced the altar of a Spanish church.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Jose below?" whispered Bell. She nodded. "Why did you save that boy,
      just now? A new lover?" She directed upon him a level glance of hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do what pleases me, senor." She raised her arm high, beginning the
      first stamping measure of a Spanish dance. Instantly there was a curious
      rumbling noise in the stable underneath. Rosa swept over the candelabra.
      All the lights in the place were struck out. Phillips and Driscoll slipped
      two great bolts, and the entire bar-room floor swung downward on hinges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chute to purgatory was open!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was bedlam in that dank pass to the region of shades, and no quarter
      was shown to any man; only cries of "The String! The String!" from members
      of the gang in order to distinguish the robbers from the robbed, in the
      darkness. There were curses, the kicking and squealing of horses in their
      stalls; a verse from the Talmud recited in Yiddish (which suddenly
      stopped), and above it all the high and hysterical laugh of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy turned from the peddler's pack as Rosa entered the room. "What is
      that horrible noise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fight. Come, you had better go." She led him down a dark stair to
      another section of the cellar. "Jose," she called. An evil looking Mexican
      pushed open a rough door. "You shall take this man out through the second
      tunnel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Si, senora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, Jose, he shall reach the outer opening alive, and with all his
      belongings. He has no money. Do you hear?" Jose grunted. "Go, now, under,
      cover of the noise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the gift for Elena!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa laughed mockingly. "What a child it is! My gift to Elena tonight, is
      you&mdash;her lover. Ask her to thank me with a prayer from her pure heart
      for my sins."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jose led the young man through a long, damp, evil-odored passage
      underground, and out through a trapdoor at the extreme end of the garden.
      A shrub grew on top of the door, surrounded by a bed of fragrant wild
      pansies. Jose kicked the staring youth away from the entrance and vanished
      into the earth looking, in the lantern-light like a malevolent fiend
      returning to the realm of everlasting fire.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The balls which were given at the Franklin House on the old Pioneer road
      were the most pretentious of the year. Feminine loveliness in silks and
      cameos gathered from every section. General Sutter and his officers
      sometimes were there, and the Spanish grandees brought to them the lovely,
      star-eyed beauties of their households.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this night a brilliant assemblage stood about in the ballroom floor
      ready for a quadrille. Elena Ashley and her betrothed were near the wide
      entrance doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is Sheriff Paul of Calaveras County," she told him. "He does not
      dance. I wonder what brings him here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doors opened and Rosa Phillips entered, magnificently jewelled and
      dressed in a rich silk of pearl grey. Elena stared, clutching at her
      partner's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, look!" she shrieked, "she is wearing my wedding dress. My wedding
      dress which was stitched at the shop of Rosenthal the peddler, in
      Sacramento, and which he was to bring me two weeks ago. I know it is mine!
      There is the pearl passe-mentre on it that was my mother's. There is none
      other like it in California!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So?" answered Rosa cooly, glancing down at the voluminous silken folds of
      her robe. Then she stood waving her big fan, her large, dark eyes roving
      across the throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine Host" came quickly forward. "It is not permitted, senora, that you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa smiled cynically. "I, the silken hawk, came not to flutter your nest
      of doves, senor. I came but for a little hour to meet a man who&mdash;Ah,
      he is coming now. Sheriff Paul, I have that to tell you which&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff offered his arm ceremoniously and they passed out of the
      ballroom. Tender hearted Elena was conscience stricken. She dropped her
      lover's arm and darted after them through the big doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am sorry, I did not mean&mdash;please, Sheriff Paul, she may have
      the dress, poor thing! But for her, I should have had no man to marry on
      my wedding day next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheriff Paul turned quickly. Elena, frightened, clapped two little hands
      over her mouth. Rosa shrugged indifferently, and tipping back her small,
      black head, listened to the music in the ballroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," to Rosa, "you sent for me, making strange promises which, for the
      safety of this community, I hope that you are now pleased to keep."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without lowering her chin she looked at him through sinister, narrowed
      eyelids, and a smile of triumphant malice touched her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Senor, I make no promises which I fail to keep," she answered, "and there
      is also a promise which I made Senor Tom Bell&mdash;"
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "There is some one knocking at the cellar door," said Tom Bell to
      Phillips. "See who is there, and be careful that you let no one in without
      the bullet and the password."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, I'm afraid," whined Driscoll "that Spanish devil's promised to get
      you hung more than once lately, and last night I know she sent that
      Mexican Jose of hers out somewhere with a string and bullet. I saw them&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Why didn't you tell me before? Listen! Phillips is in trouble! Go
      help him! Call the boys! Hurry!" As Jim Driscoll, with a halt in his walk,
      left him, Tom Bell stole quietly to one of the tunnels and ran to the
      trap-door which opened into an outhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the corral full of saddle-horses and the Mountaineer House
      completely surrounded by Sheriff Paul's, posse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, boys," said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he get in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye-ah&mdash;put his hand in with the bullet on a string, got his foot in
      the door, gave the password and heaved the door wide open. Come on, now,
      and there's orders not to take the woman, remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bell stole a rawboned roan from the corral and was far from the frightful
      battle at Mountaineer House before he dared burst forth into the
      vituperation which he heaped upon the name of Rosa Phillips.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Rosa sat strumming her guitar idly, and musing upon the events of the past
      few months. Jack Phillips was serving a term in prison. Driscoll had also
      been sent to the penitentiary. One day a rumor reached her that he was
      threatening to turn state's evidence, and to divulge the truth in regard
      to Rosenthal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later an iron bar was accidentally(?) dropped on his head;
      through some mysterious agent he was given poison, and died. At the memory
      of it Rosa smiled her enigmatic and implacable smile. Tom Bell was at
      large somewhere far to the north and she&mdash;she was rich now and she
      would go back to Monterey, perhaps. She drew her guitar closer and sang:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The far distant sound of a harp's soft strings&mdash;an echo on the air,
      The hidden page may be full of sweet things, of things that once were
      fair. There's a turned down page in each life, and mine&mdash;a story
      might unfold, But the end was sad of the dream divine. It better rests
      untold."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was time for Harlan to arrive. Charlie Harlan, the man whom she hoped
      to cajole into buying Mountaineer House. She strolled out into the garden
      as Harlan rode up and tied his horse under one of the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      A happy pair passed. A delicate girl mounted upon a little mule and a
      sturdy youth walking in the dust, his hand upon the beast's shoulder. With
      their serene and joy-illumined faces they somehow suggested the holy
      family, symbolical of all that was divine in a sordid world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled and waved to Rosa, but the young man doffed his hat coldly
      and hastened by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sweet little Elena," said Rosa to herself, "and her lover-husband. I
      wear the silken wedding gown which no lover sees, but she travels the way
      in calico with the man she loves. May the Blessed Virgin grant that she
      shall have no turned down pages in her life," and forcing her proud and
      bitter mouth into a provocative smile, she went forward to welcome Harlan.

     "He goes to the well,
     And he stands on the brink,
     And stops for a spell
     Jest to listen and think:
     Let's see&mdash;well, that forty-foot grave wasn't his, sir,

      Everywhere in the foothills of the Sierras there are still evidences of
      gold mining. High cliffs face the rivers, all that is left of hills torn
      down at the point of the powerful hydraulic nozzles, with great heaps of
      cobbles at their base which Mother Nature, even in seventy years has been
      unable to change or cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mouth of nearly every ravine there are countless little mounds
      which marked the end, or dump of the sluice-box in the placer mining. When
      the mound got the proper height the sluice was simply lengthened, like
      putting another joint onto a caterpillar&mdash;and there you were! The
      sluice-boxes have long since been moved away or rotted to mould but the
      little mounds remain, to be mansions for hustling colonies of small black
      ants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country, in various localities, is pitted with prospect holes, and the
      hills are pierced with drift tunnels and abandoned mines. Some of the
      prospect holes are mere grassy cups, others are very deep and partly
      filled with water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the most engrossing days of my childhood were spent in exploring
      these places with my two boy companions. We would fell an oak sapling
      across the mouth of the hole, tie a rope, usually my pony's lariat, to the
      tree and slide down it to explore the depths below. If we came to a side
      drift we would swing into it, light our candle-lanterns and go looking for
      gold. We were always sure that we should yet find a forgotten cache of
      gold&mdash;perhaps guarded by a lonely skeleton&mdash;but we never did!
    </p>
    <p>
      About all we ever got out of it was snake-frights (naturally, sans
      alcoholic origin), until we were sure, the snakes were not rattlers; baby
      bats, which invariably tried to bite us; swallows' eggs, wet feet, and a
      good spanking if the family happened to find out what we had been up to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose that it really was a very dangerous pastime, for although
      sometimes the drift tunnel led us to a sunlit opening on the hillside,
      more often we reached a blind end and were forced to return to the main
      shaft and to "shin" up the rope, with from ten to forty feet of inky water
      waiting to catch us if we fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or we went up the river to "swing the rocker" for old Ali Quong. He always
      pretended to drive us away, bellowing fiercely as soon as he caught sight
      of us, "Whassa malla you? Alle time you come see Ali Quong! Ketchem too-oo
      much tlouble for po-or old Chinaman"&mdash;the whole time with his
      wrinkled, brown face wreathed in smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      There we stayed the long summer afternoon, swinging the rocker while Quong
      shoveled in the pebbly dirt, watching him take the black sand, which held
      the gold, off the canvas with his little spade-like scoop, and panning it
      for him in the heavy iron pan, fascinated to see what we should find.
      Usually only a few small nuggets in a group of colors (flake gold), but
      once we found a good sized nugget which Quong gallantly gave me for a
      "Chinese New Year" gift. At dusk he sent us home, each with a bar of brown
      barley sugar&mdash;smelling to the blue of opium&mdash;which he fished out
      of one of his numerous jumpers with his long-fingered, sensitive hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are dead, long ago&mdash;Ah Quong, old Sing, Shotgun-Chinaman&mdash;and
      gone to the blessed region of the Five Immortals, I know, but every true
      Californian will understand the regard the pioneer families had for these
      faithful Chinese servitors who took as much loving pride in the
      aristocratic and unblemished names of their "familees" as the white
      persons who bore them. Four generations of my family, old Sing lived to
      serve&mdash;but I must get on with my forty-niner's tale of the hanging of
      Charlie Price!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, mon, but the spring is here again," said Jim "Hutch" (Hutchinson) to
      Old Man Greeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it so, now?" returned the little man, gazing off through the sunny,
      velvet air to a world which had been painted clean, new green. His shrewd,
      blue eyes returned to the ponderous Scotchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how came you to realize that it was spring?" he asked maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How came you to lick Sandy McArthur-r-r?" Hutchinson came back at him.
      "Tell me that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but whisper, man," said old Jimmie plaintively, "what else could a
      man be after doin'? Me boots were on, an' I could not run away an' climb a
      tree, so I used them on McArthur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye're a wild fightin' Irishman with no regard for the Sabbath," returned
      Jim Hutch, sternly. Now Greeley had a fear of what the dour old Scotchman
      might tell upon him. It would not pay to lose his Celtic temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was to church I was goin'." he growled. "'Twas why I was wearin' me
      red-topped high boots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where was church that day, whatever? At the Widow Schmitt's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie squirmed. "You mentioned the beautiful spring, I mind," he
      countered deftly. Suddenly Jim Hutch grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell ye why. I was gaein' down frae Rattlesnake this afternoon an'
      Charlie Price an' his Leezie were out in his bit garden a-plowin'. Mon, ye
      could hear him for miles!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was even so. Old Charlie Price had decided that it was high time to put
      in his vegetable garden. He went out to the lean-to in his corral to
      inform Lizzie, the mare, of his intention. Lizzie was always the unwilling
      partner of these agricultural peregrinations, and, now she saw him
      approaching with the harness, she ran away with much snorting and
      scattering of sod.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey, you, Liz," roared Charlie, "you goot-for-not'ing buckskin lummix,
      you com mit!" He flourished the halter rope at her. Lizzie flattened her
      ears, opened her mouth like a yawning snake, and ran at him. Old Charlie
      let out a whoop that brought the sheriff from Rattlesnake at full speed,
      and could be heard (so they say) all the way across the river to Wild
      Goose Flat, six miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Lizzie, accustomed as she was to Charlie's mannerisms, was frankly
      startled and meekly allowed herself to be caught. She did not like to
      plow. She was a saddler and a pair of tugs and a collar bored her. With a
      cinch one could puff out in true wild-horse fashion while the latigo strap
      was being pulled, and afterward be fairly comfortable, but a slipping
      collar was neither off nor on. She shook herself impatiently and the
      collar slid down her neck to her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey!" bellowed Charlie, "you don't vear it so! You&mdash;" The mare
      stamped at a fly, bringing her hoof down on the old Dutchman's foot. His
      blood-curdling whoops and yells brought the sheriff in on a brilliant
      finale to a record-breaking run.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter? Are you being murdered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, I'm?" asked Charlie, absent-mindedly. He was nursing the injured
      member, wondering whether to kick at Lizzie with it, knowing full well
      that he stood a good chance of her kicking back again' but when she
      snapped viciously at the puffing sheriff he decided against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You com' to see me?" he asked, in a bland, so-glad-you've-called tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To see you! Why, I've come to save your life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So? Dot's goot, but Lizzie undt me, ve ain't got so much time today. It's
      vegetables I sell in Rattlesnake undt ve go to plow, now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you old fool, after this you can call in vain if anything happens
      to you. I'll never bother with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, vell, ven I got a little excitement I got to yell about it, ain't
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe you have&mdash;and after this you can, for all of me," and the
      wrathful sheriff departed. He was new in the community or he would have
      known that the plowing of Charlie Price and Lizzie was a regular event of
      each season, for which an audience gathered to lay bets for and against
      the probability of his dying of apoplexy before it was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plowing progressed in this manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie put the point of the plow in the soft earth and roared at the
      motor-power. Lizzie started off at a nimble lope. The plow cut a pretty
      curve and flew out of the ground. Charlie reefed the reins at once,
      completely turning off the power. Then he put the reins about his neck,
      grasped the handles of the plow with both hands, and zoomed commands again
      at the champing power. "Power" jumped ahead. The reins nearly snapped old
      Charlie's head off, but effectually brought the mare to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vait, you dunder-undt-blitzen apful peelings! You&mdash;you think dot
      plowing is not high-toned enough, yet&mdash;hey? Vell, I show you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up a huge clod of soft dirt held it aloft in both hands and
      banged it down on Lizzie's back&mdash;whereupon she promptly ran away! She
      galloped furiously to the end of the field with the plow banging in scoops
      and leaps, and old Charlie, dangling on the end of the reins, flying along
      in seven-league jumps behind her. As soon as he caught his breath
      sufficiently for renewed directions, the cavalcade returned to the
      grandstand and operations were repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie had been a sailor before he came to California, and he plowed (?)
      each furrow with a collection of forceful admonitions, delivered in a
      voice of thunder, from a different language. It was all the same to
      Lizzie! She loathed plowing just as thoroughly in wildcat Spanish, as she
      did in Dutch or Cingalese, and she did not hesitate to prove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Hutch and Jimmie Greeley drifted down to Rattlesnake at sundown and
      joined the laughter-weakened group perched upon Charlie's snake fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man grows more daft every year. 'Tis strange, what charms the Widow
      Schmitt." Old Jimmie merely growled in his beard. "Charlie, mon," he
      called, "the mare is warm and weary, and so's yoursel'. Come on to town
      for a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie stayed overlong at the miners' haunts in Rattlesnake and it was
      very late when he started back to his cabin, carrying in one limp, hot
      hand a jug which he guarded zealously from harm during his unsteady
      progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men still sat over the card tables when the first daylight crept over
      the mountains. Jimmie Greeley was raking in a jackpot, grinning fiendishly
      at the dour Jim Hutch when they heard heavy, running feet outside. The
      door crashed open and a frightened, half-grown lad shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's the sheriff? Charlie Price has been hung!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On a tree near the Widow Schmitt's. I saw him. I know well the sailor
      coat that he wears&mdash;and his best red-topped boots. Where's the
      sheriff?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over at Ah Quong's, the Chinee store on the edge of town." The boy ran
      off. Old Jim Hutch rose impressively to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends, the man ye hae laughed at all day&mdash;is dead. The man ye hae
      always laughed at&mdash;and yet, WHO was it that lent ye gold when ye had
      none? Yea, the gold ye thought it not worth ye'r while to return. Who was
      ever ready to warm you at his bit fire in winter or to cool ye're
      whuskey-hot throat with water from his cool spring in summer?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was it that brought his mare into his own kitchen when it snowed, and
      fed her the rice and beans he went without? Who was it that the Widow
      Schmitt waits for year after year, with half the ould fools in Placer
      dancin' after her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was too much for old man Greeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he was indifferent-like. When ye want a woman, run away f-r-r-om
      her and she'll run after."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did ye na do it, then, Jeems?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith an' I did, but bein' ahl dressed up as I was in me coat, she
      couldn't see me suspenders to tell was I comin' or goin'!" Jim Hutch
      turned from him witheringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was it staked ye for a new prospectin' trip, an' let his own mine go
      unworked? Who nursed ye when ye were lyin' seeck unto death, an' no one
      would come nigh on account of the smallpox scare? Old Charlie Price."
    </p>
    <p>
      A boy whirled about to face the window, but not before one uncontrollable
      sob had sounded through the quiet room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was it," went on the old Scotchman gently, "found the wee bairn that
      was lost, last summer; that followed the Indians for thirty miles on his
      Leezie-mare and got the babe from out the wickiup of White Beaver? Charlie
      Price.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who came bringing it haeme laughing, on the saddle pommel while he sang
      to it songs from ower seven seas, which we did blush to hear, in a voice
      to be heard twa miles about? And 'twas only the bairn's mother who thought
      to thank him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yea, and furthermore, when the incensed people would hae wipet out the
      while tribe of White Beaver, who dashed at the mob wi' the roars of a
      bull-bison forcin' them to hear that the squaw was crazed from the death
      of her own bit bairn, and but tryin' to comfort her sore heart? Who, I'm
      askin' ye?" and from each man's lips came the murmur like a response to a
      litany:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charlie Price."
    </p>
    <p>
      From the open door a cool dawn breeze blew in from the Sierras, pure
      forerunner to the new day. It whirled the heavy smoke plumes into forms of
      vanished ghosts, like the tortured figments of each man's conscience who
      had done, and "left undone" that which it was forever too late to amend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This boy says that old Charlie is gone." He stood with his broad hat off,
      running his fingers nervously through his hair. "Gentlemen&mdash;I&mdash;I
      must confess&mdash;I heard the poor man calling, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mon, in an ancient book named 'Mr. Aesop, His Fables,' there was a tale
      of the lad who cried 'wolf.' Many there are here who have read it. Come,
      let us gae after poor Charlie."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first daylight they reached the tree with its gruesome burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;but," sputtered the keen-eyed little Irishman, "'Tis not
      Charlie at all! 'Tis but an effigy dressed in Charlie's clothes and hung
      at the Widow Schmitt's gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a warnin' to him frae some mutton-head lover of hers."
    </p>
    <p>
      They ran as one man across the road to Charlie's cabin. It was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was callin' 'Help'," said the round-eyed boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we heard him," added the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come up the road. They started back down the trail.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Charlie had got nearly home when he began to worry about a deep prospect
      hole near the trail known as "Rosenhammer's Shaft." He must be careful to
      avoid it. Suddenly his foot slipped on a pebble. He clutched unavailingly
      at a manzanita and rolled into a circle of inky blackness. Rosenhammer's
      Shaft! Now he was lost, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, no. As he slid he came against a sturdy live-oak bush which he
      clutched, managing to stop his descent into the next world for the time
      being. He even, swung one leg over a wiry limb, and there he clung,
      puttering sailors' argot, considering his sins, and roaring for help in
      his best fortissimo tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shaft was said to be a hundred feet deep. It was filled part way with
      oily water, and inhabited by snakes and monsters of the subterranean
      deeps. People had fallen in and drowned, and had been known never to rise
      again. The ghost of a Chinaman who had been murdered and flung down, was
      said to float up from its depths at night to range the earth, seeking the
      perpetrator of the fiendish deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie wished that he had led a more blameless life that he had not so
      thoroughly beaten the Indian who had sold him a salted mine; that he had
      not made Lizzie plow; that, above all, he had married the Widow Schmitt
      when she had so plainly shown her liking for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it did not matter much. He would fall in forty feet of water and
      they would never find him. He wished that he had drunk that which the jug
      contained. It was growing daylight. What was the day, then, to him? He
      would never live to see it. His arms were numb. He must soon let go and
      fall to his doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard voices but was too spent to call out. As a crowd of men came
      running over the hill, his arms were slipping&mdash;slipping. It was
      almost broad day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made one last, herculean effort to hold fast, turning his head over his
      shoulder to glance into the deathtrap below and&mdash;just as his
      repentant rescuers reached him, he gave a disgusted snort and fell&mdash;three
      feet to the bottom of the hole!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness he had safely passed the Rosenhammer shaft and had fallen
      into the six-feet-deep prospect hole of his own claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, Charlie married the Widow Schmitt

    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Again swings the lash on the high mountain trail,
     And the pipe of the packer is scenting the gale;
     For the trails are all open, the roads are all free,
     And the highwayman's whistle is heard on the lea."

    &mdash;Bret Harte.
</pre>
    <p>
      We were riding one day under the Digger pines, down an abandoned old road
      toward Mountaineer House. As usual, my spirited half-Arab, as white as she
      was fleet, had put me far in the lead. She loved a race as well as I did,
      but she ran it to suit herself. If I tried to interpose any theories of my
      own, she calmly took the bit in her teeth and after that I devoted most of
      my energies to hanging on!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mammy Kate, own daughter of Nancy Gooch of Coloma, would scold when I came
      home with torn skirt and a bump on my forehead: "Now, den, look at dat
      chile! Been hoss-racin' agin su'ah as Moses was in Egypt! I shall suttenly
      enjine yo' fathah to done gin' yo' plow-hoss to ride so yo's gwi' git beat
      wiff yo' racin', and quit. Spects yo' had 'nothah tumble, didn't you'?
      You' wait till Katie gits de camph-fire an' put on dat haid."
    </p>
    <p>
      So did Katie's scoldings invariably end in renewed pampering of her
      "chile," and so did I continue to race every horse in the community and
      usually to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one small ear laid back to listen for the other horses, little white
      Flossie flew along the grassy track, darting around the chapparal bushes
      which had grown up and jumping the fallen tree trunks. Suddenly we came
      out of the woods and she shied violently at a man who was digging a
      fence-post hole, directly in the road. I always rode Indian fashion
      without stirrups of any kind, so of course I was catapulted neatly over
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello. Otto," I said, remaining seated in the road and catching at Floss'
      bridle rein, "what have you found?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Otto was sifting the loose dirt in the hole through eager fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello! I've found some money here in the ground. I wonder&mdash;oh, yes,
      I've heard my mother tell about it! This was the old pioneer road and it
      was at this very spot that Rattlesnake Dick and some of his gang held up
      the Wells-Fargo stage coach and got such a lot of money. They say there's
      still $40,000 buried on Trinity Mountain, half of what was waiting when
      Rattlesnake Dick got killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rattlesnake Dick, pirate of the placers, prince of highwaymen! Magical
      name&mdash;irridescent bubble from the pipe of romance. Proud, imperious,
      bitter Dick! What a splendid old name he had been born to, and what blows
      Fate had dealt him which led to his tragic end!
    </p>
    <p>
      The others had come up by this time and we sat in a circle listening again
      to the story of the bold and brilliant Englishman whom two undeserved jail
      sentences had turned into such a picturesque dare-devil of a highwayman.
      However, I disagreed with Otto's version of the robber chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have made him out all bad," I told him. "I have heard the story
      often, and he wasn't all bad by any means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was a wild desperado. Why, even after he was dead and lying on the
      sidewalk in Auburn, a man came up and kicked his face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and they say that everybody in the county was mad about it, and when
      the man ran for supervisor more than a year later, no decent person would
      vote for him and he lost his election." Now, the true story of Rattlesnake
      Dick is this, and I never tire of hearing it:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you present me to your sister's friend, then, George?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am an Ishmailite! I, the son of an honorable English gentleman, have
      done a term in prison."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But these ideas are extreme, Dick. There is no such general opinion of
      you. Were you not exonerated from having stolen the wretched little Jew's
      goods? It is all forgotten," and George Taylor paused in his restless
      pacing, before the long, graceful figure on the bunk against the wall.
      Dick raised handsome eyes whose flashing light was made of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "George, I wish&mdash;how I wish that it were forgotten. But it is not.
      They whisper it in doorways, and over the card tables and down in the
      drift tunnels. Wherever I go it follows me like an evil spirit, rearing
      its unclean head between me and all fair things." His deep voice reflected
      the hurt in his dark eyes, and his broad shoulders drooped in despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dick&mdash;Dick, the gay the debonair&mdash;this is not like you. Brace
      up, man, and come with me to this opening of the new opera house, if only
      to add to my pleasure. All the town will be there to hear the singer who
      has just landed in San Francisco from Boston."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She it was who brought you the letter from your sister?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes. They were school-mates. She is beautiful, and you shall meet
      her after the concert."
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Opera House" was crowded, the front rows seating the leading men of
      the community and their richly clad wives and daughters. In the back rows,
      seated on benches and around the side walls were, the roughly dressed
      miners and the usual flotsam of a mining town. The singer was not of the
      hurdy-gurdy type so common in those days, but a "lady," young, lovely and
      accomplished. Her ballads were greeted with the greatest enthusiasm, and
      soon the stage began to be showered with gold. The miners brought her back
      again and again, calling the names of songs they wished to hear. Hundreds
      of dollars of gold were tossed up to her, whilst she smilingly complied
      with all their requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One more," they shouted, "only one more, and her slippers shall be filled
      with gold dust." She slipped out of her little sandals and stood, blushing
      modestly, hiding her silken feet under her long, wide skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind to a lonely stranger," she called, to an instantly
      silenced audience, "and I will sing for you a song which has but lately
      come from London. 'Tis from a new opera called the Bohemian Girl, composed
      by Master Balfe," and folding her little hands before her, she sang
      sweetly, "Then You'll Remember Me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When other lips and other hearts their tales of love shall tell Of days
      that have as happy been, and you'll remember&mdash;you'll remember me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dick, why do you cover your eyes? You are surely not asleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By all the Gods, man, the accusation is an insult," with a haughty flash
      of his great eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are to be presented; have you forgotten?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgotten! While life lasts, I shall remember this night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, this is the last. She is singing, 'Home, Sweet Home'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, 'Home,' for these wanderers from all over the earth. See how
      silently they file out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is many a tear among them. They will lie, tonight on memory's couch
      of sad dreams."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are wrong, my friend," said Dick bitterly; "they are more like to
      hasten down to the gambling hells to kill the visions memory would
      recall."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "Sweet Bird, you cannot believe this thing of me!" The Singer-Lady raised
      her bright head from Dick's shoulder, and met, steadfastly, his
      passionately adoring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard, how can you for one moment doubt me? I know you to be good and
      true. Were you not exonerated from the last accusation of which you
      informed me before you asked for my hand in marriage. And do we not know
      that this man is actuated by the motive of jealousy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Mormon beast! He knows well that I did not steal his mule."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No' naughty boy," tapping him playfully with her fan, "'Twas something
      else you stole from Master Crow the woman he wanted. Often have I noticed
      on the streets how all women, every one, turn to look after you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cared not for her." He shook his tall and beautiful head, impatient of
      the silky black lock which fell across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps then 'tis your magnificent carriage they would admire," laughed
      the girl, teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick swept her close to his heart. "My golden-throated dove, I cannot join
      in your sweet laughter, for I have a boding heart, this day. I have
      enemies. They will use my past record. The courts are new, and judgments
      swift and cold. If they should send me again to the penitentiary I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest I should know you to be innocent, and I should wait for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her tenderly on cheeks, and eyes, and mouth. He took her hands
      from his shoulders, slipping off the little silken mitts and putting them
      in an inner pocket, and kissed the soft, pink palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Lady-Bird, if I should not return you'll remember me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own pure love! No breath of shame shall ever sully your fair name
      through me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right well I know that, Richard. God bless you. I will pray for you every
      hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      At evening George Taylor brought her a note from Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, George," she wailed, "they have sentenced him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two years in prison."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he was innocent!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and some day it will be proven." He looked at her strangely, "I must
      tell you&mdash;Dick has broken jail and fled north to Shasta county, where
      he will begin life anew. Then, if you still wish it, he will come to you."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      After four years the Singer-Lady returned for a concert at the little
      Opera House in Rattlesnake. She went to her old quarters at the Widow
      Miller's, on the edge of town.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, Dearie," cried the good woman, "what have they been doing to ye, so
      to dim your bright youth, and to bring the sad lines to your mouth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Miller, where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah&mdash;so that's the answer." The girl's eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four years&mdash;and for the last two, no word. I must find George
      Taylor. Perhaps he&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearie, George Taylor is with Dick, and the Skinners and Cherokee Bob and
      Lame Jim Driscoll. They say, too, that at times Dick rides with Tom Bell's
      gang."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, he tried with all a strong man's power to win a new name for himself&mdash;and
      for you&mdash;but Fate was too strong. His false record followed him up
      and down the state from every idle throat, casting a blight over all he
      sought to, do. Every sheriff hounded him on. Each unproven crime was laid
      at his door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why did he not come to me? Oh, he had my whole heart, and he knew
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did come to you two years ago, to ask if you would return to Canada
      with him, hoping that it was too far for tales from California to travel.
      As soon as he reached San Francisco he was recognized by one of the
      authorities and 'shown up' by the Vigilante Committee in the Plaza, as
      they put up all dangerous characters for the police and the people to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And whilst he was there you passed, walking with another man, and looked
      him in the eyes and knew him not. 'Twas that which broke his heart and
      made him the reckless and brilliant devil that he is today."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;but," cried the Singer-Lady, recovering from the daze these
      words had placed upon her, "I did not pass. Oh, I should have fallen at
      his feet&mdash;lost to all maidenly reserve&mdash;there before the people.
      It must have been my sister, who had but lately come from Boston and so
      would not know him," and she broke into uncontrollable weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, child, dry your tears. Try to be brave. You care for him still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always. I have never ceased to pray for him. If I cannot become his, I
      shall go lonely to my grave. Tell me everything, kind Mrs. Miller."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He robs the stages of the Wells-Fargo box, but lets the passengers go
      free, and he has never been known to take anything from a woman. He says
      that since all the world is against him, his hand is against the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His den is now at Folsom, they say, but he ranges far afield. He robs the
      sluices, and the bullion trains, but he does not take horses or mules
      except to get away with his booty. No cell can hold him. He has escaped
      from every jail in the northern mines. He has been known to say, 'I shall
      never rot in a prison as long as a revolver can keep me out."'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, would he&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would, indeed, Dearie, for the sake of his family name and the love he
      bears you. His last big raid was upon George Barstow's Wells-Fargo train
      from Yreka. They held them up on Trinity Mountain. Eighty thousand dollars
      in bullion, they got, even with twenty men guarding it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Miller tiptoed to the window and looked out. Coming back to the girl
      she whispered, "The guards are tied to trees, and the gang is waiting for
      Dick and Cy Skinner to get back with new mules, as the Wells-Fargo mules
      all are branded and would give them away, but if he finds out that you are
      here he may&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Singer-Lady sprang to her feet! From the trees behind the house
      floated a snatch of song in a clear baritone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When coldness or deceit shall slight the beauty now they prize; When
      hollow hearts shall wear a mask, 'twill break your own to see. At such a
      moment I but ask that you'll remember me, you'll&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the girl was sobbing in Dick's arms, and the
      misunderstandings of four years were soon explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Singer-Lady lifted her head at last to the sound of galloping horses.
      Dick was looking calmly in their direction. Terror seized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must return to the house. They must not see you here."
    </p>
    <p>
      She clung to him with the wail of a breaking heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the sheriff and his deputies. This morning George and I were on the
      Folsom stage. We were stopped by a deputy sheriff and sternly requested to
      alight. We entered into conversation with the gentleman of the law&mdash;whom
      I had met several times before" (with a grim smile), "and finally George,
      with due deference to authority, demanded to be shown the warrant for our
      arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whilst the simple creature was fumbling for it, we opened fire and,
      springing from the top of the stage, escaped across Harmon Hill. The vain
      fellow carried only a derringer, and how was one little bullet to stop our
      race for liberty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet you returned here! That was madness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard of you and the longing to see you once more overcame every other
      feeling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not fear, I knew that they would come. What was that to pay for the
      chance of seeing you again. They can but put me in Auburn jail, and no
      locks can hold me except the shining ones on this dear head. No prison can
      keep me till I am laid in that last one beneath the grass, and there I
      will wait for you dear love. I shall not hear the celestian singing till
      your sweet voice has joined the angel choir, and your two hands&mdash;see,
      I still carry the little mitts&mdash;shall open the door for me to
      Paradise, as they have held all of heaven for me on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be in that last court, the Great judge of all will look into my
      heart which strove to be honorable and will dismiss the accusations of
      mere, mortal man."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As usual, Dick escaped the jail and with George Taylor attempted to get
      away, but Fate had dealt him her last blow and on the scroll of his
      precarious and bitter life had written finis. A mile above Auburn they
      were overtaken by Assessor George W. Martin and Deputy Sheriffs Crutcher
      and Johnston. In the terrible encounter which ensued Martin was instantly
      killed and Dick mortally wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode more than a mile at a furious pace, from the scene of his last
      fight, before Dick lay down to die. George put him on his great riding
      cloak and spread a saddle blanket over him. Then when he read a fresh
      command in the highwayman's dark eyes he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dick, old friend&mdash;I cannot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am shot through the breast, and again through the side. You promised
      that when I came to this pass, you would grant the liberation I seek in
      death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot. From any hand but mine may you find release."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well" answered Dick, resolutely, "my own hand shall be given the
      power to save my immortal soul." He wrote laboriously on a bit of paper,
      "Rattlesnake Dick dies but never surrenders, as all true Britons do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go, George," he said gently, "but first give me my pistol. I have in my
      pocket here a letter from the sweetest of women. It says, 'I have grieved
      but never despaired, for I have prayed to the Father that he would restore
      you to the paths of rectitude, and I say faithfully, He will save you. He
      sees in your heart a secret wish to be a better man. 'Seek ye first the
      kingdom of God, and all things shall be added thereunto.' He will raise
      your head and make of you a new man'! I go to Him, my brother." And,
      raising his gun, with a good woman's adored name on his lips, he released
      his sorely tried heart from bondage into the unknown.

      High water on the American came, usually, when the first warm rains melted
      the snow on the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The placer miners toiled at furious pace all during the summer and fall.
      The water, then not more than a rivulet, was deflected through flumes from
      the river bed, so that all the sand of the bars could be put through the
      sluices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men worked till the last possible moment in the narrow river bed, only
      leaving in time to save their lives, and abandoning everything to the
      sudden rush of the water. Their sluices, logs, flumes, water-wheels, all
      their mining paraphernalia, sometimes even their living outfits, were
      swept away in the floods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river was known to rise from 20 to 60 feet in 24 hours, in its narrow
      and precipitous walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      At flood time, then, we often went down to the river through the orchard
      of big old cherry trees planted by my grandfather, to watch the mass of
      wreckage rushing by. Great logs would go down end over end; mining
      machinery caught in the limbs of uprooted trees; quantities of lumber, and
      once a miner's bunk with sodden gray blanket and a wet and frantic
      squirrel upon it. I worried for days over the fate of that squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tell the story of a Chinaman floating down upon a log.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, John, where you go?" was shouted. John shook his head, sadly.

    <p>
      "Me no sabe! Maybe Saclimento&mdash;maybe San Flancisco. No got time
      talkee, now."

      "Look, the water is up to the top of the old stone pier," said one of the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mammy Kate's 'ghost' would have a hard time haunting it now," I laughed.
      "He'd be under twenty feet of water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ghost?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, the tollkeeper's, of the old bridge. The one who hated the Indians
      so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Bear River tribe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were Diggers, but I think that nobody knew exactly which ones were
      guilty. It was a fine bridge, the first suspension bridge in Placer
      county."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was washed away in the floods during the winter of '61 and '62, wasn't
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes and they built the new one a mile up the river at Rattlesnake Bar,
      where it still hangs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about the tollkeeper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the story&mdash;with a bit of a prologue.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Captain Ezekiel Merritt, one of the "Bear Flag" party in Sonoma, came in
      '49 to try his luck at mining on the Middle Fork of the American. His
      party came at last, through a deep canyon to a large bar on which they
      found among unmistakable evidences of a plundered camp both white man's
      and Indian's hair. A great ash heap containing calcined bones was
      undoubtedly the funeral pyre of white men and red men alike, and some
      yelling savages upon the upper bluff confirmed the tragedy which Captain
      Merritt's party had been too late to avert.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove the Indians away and Captain Merritt cut into the bark of an
      alder the name "Murderer's Bar," by which the place has been called ever
      since.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Merritt party stayed to work the bar. Before the summer passed the
      river swarmed with men, some of whom joined forces to make up mining
      companies. One of the rules of such a company: "Any shareholder getting
      drunk during the time he should be on duty, shall pay into the common
      treasury of the company a fine of one ounce of gold dust and shall forfeit
      all dividends during such time." These fines, in some instances, became so
      frequent as to cause a total disruption of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indians returned to their villages in the hills. The foothill Indians
      were not a particularly intelligent lot. They were Diggers, so named on
      account of their habits of digging in the ground for roots, and the larva
      of various insects for food. Eggs of ants, and the maggots found in wasp's
      nests were considered great delicacies.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also ate dried grasshoppers and young clover plants cooked as greens.
      They ground acorns and manzanita berries into meal with the stone mortars
      and pestles so commonly found through the countryside and gathered and
      stored great caches of pine burrs full of nuts for the winter. They were
      not as a rule quarrelsome, but&mdash;.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "Good morning, Phineas. I have brought your grub from Auburn, and here is
      the bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright day in June and Phineas Longley, tollkeeper for the new
      suspension bridge on Whiskey Bar, had had a busy morning. There was a
      barbecue that day at the town on the other side, and a stream of people
      had come down the Whiskey Bar turnpike and crossed the bridge. It was
      getting warm and he was tired, and he read the bill gloomily:
    </p>
    <p>
      "1 bottle gin, $6.00; 2 lbs. biscuits, $2.50; 1 ham, $24.00; 1 bottle
      pickles, $6.00; 4 fathoms rope, $5.00; 1 watermelon, $4.00; 1 tin pan,
      $16.00; 2 apples, $3.00."
    </p>
    <p>
      Longley stuffed the bill in his pocket, and returned for his noon meal to
      his log cabin on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite palatial&mdash;boasting a real floor made of puncheons, or
      hewn logs. A bunk, against the wall, was made of a second log set four
      feet from the log wall, with a hammock mattress of sacking stuffed with
      dried bracken stretched between them. There was the usual huge fireplace
      of granite rocks used for both warmth and cooking, and a box
      pantry-cupboard nailed to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cup and plate and saucer were of tin, and his cutlery was an iron
      spoon, a three-tined fork and a hunting dagger. The dishes had not been
      washed for weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In warm weather he kept a few things in a small palisade driven in the
      shallow water at the river's edge, which was cool the year 'round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longley put his raised bread dough in a frying pan, put a second pan on
      top, raked the ashes off some coals, and started it baking. A man on
      horseback, driving two pack animals before him, stopped at the low
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, John! Glad to see you," called Longley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to get here. Like to sleep in a house again. Tired of shaking the
      lizards out of my blankets every morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever shake out a rattler?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet, though they say it's been done more than once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're just in time. Turn the beasts into the corral. And then will you
      just ride back to Kitty Douglas' for me? She promised me a pie, and I need
      a new starter for my sour dough (batter). By that time everything will be
      ready to eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean the 'Kitty Douglas' of the signs I've just passed?" asked John,
      grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. What were they, today?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Fresh pies, by Kitty Douglas,' 'Bread made every day, by Kitty Douglas,'
      'New-laid eggs every day, by Kitty Douglas'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty's cooking is as fair as the reputation of her house is not. She
      charges two dollars for a meal of pork and beans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis the regular price everywhere. I'll be back soon." After the meal
      John went to, the barbecue, imbibing rather freely of the fire-water
      barrel and making a night of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy travel continued over the bridge all afternoon&mdash;a prairie
      schooner with three oxen, two mules and a bronco pulling it; a prospector
      in his red flannel undershirt, driving a laden donkey; a hurdy-gurdy
      troupe on its way to the barbecue; a stage-coach drawn by six half-broken
      wild horses; an old Spanish settler on a beautiful, black thoroughbred; a
      late arrival from Oregon, mounted upon a sturdy mule with his young wife
      upon a pillion behind him, and a whole drove of China-men being taken out
      to work a white man's claim up on the Divide.
    </p>
    <p>
      There passed Welch miners, who were to be the fore-runners of quartz
      mining; miners from Australia, who were to replace the wooden "bateas" of
      the Mexicans with the rocker and the iron gold-pan, and the term of
      "specimen" with "nugget."
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally came a hale, old voyaguer whom Longley greeted heartily as he
      swung open the toll gate:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Greetings, Monsieur Francois Gendron, and from whence came you today?"
      The big Frenchman handed over the "six-bits" toll for himself and his
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From New Helvetia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah&mdash;Sacramento."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I am bound for the North Fork Dry Diggings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Auburn?" smiled Longley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! the new names! In my day we called them differently. I came across
      the Rockies in '32, Monsieur. But I must be en route&mdash;here are sheep
      coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      After the sheep were counted and gone, Longley glanced scowlingly across
      the bridge and hastily closed the tollgate. A band of Indians, several on
      ponies but most of them on foot, crossed the bridge and halted before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go back, ye varmints!" growled Longley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No Indian pay," said the old chief. "He go the bridge and the road&mdash;no
      pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the Chinamen paid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the Indians, no! No pay. Me go Whiskey Bar&mdash;big pow-wow. Plenty
      ox, plenty bear meat, plenty firewater&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go back!" roared the tollkeeper, swearing, "and go ford the river.
      That's good enough for a Digger! The ferry's been taken off, but the water
      is not so high."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Indian scowled, and the young bucks began a guttural complaint
      which he silenced with a gesture and a grunt of command.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Water is cold, and those," pointing to the sheep, "have passed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go back, I tell you! I hate every filthy brute of you! My best pal
      was sent to glory in that funeral fire on Murderer's Bar, and no Indian
      will ever get aught from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me pay," said the Indian leader slowly, "Me pay cayuse, me pay boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you won't pay! You'll go back and wade the river like the low beasts
      that you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief began a fierce oration. Longley ran into the tollhouse and came
      out with a sawed-off shotgun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, will you go?" he cried, defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indians were sober, and they went. As they came abreast of the pier
      under the bridge the toll-keeper jeered and laughed at them, and pelted
      them with rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked up with hate, but went stolidly on their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      With darkness, the roistering at the barbecue became louder. The Indians'
      money was gone by this time, and the fun was getting rougher. The
      toll-keeper, after a weary day, was dozing beside his candle. He did not
      see nor hear the stealthy forms which crept up the bridge. A board
      creaked, and he jumped up and swung about, to find himself quickly
      overpowered by a dozen lithe redskins.
    </p>
    <p>
      They robbed the till, then held a palaver as to the disposition of their
      prisoner. They finally left him tied with his own new rope to a huge drift
      log at the base of the pier, and went back to buy more firewater.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wild night!
    </p>
    <p>
      John noticed, very late, that the Indians seemed to be having a special
      pow-wow of their own on the river bank near the bridge. There was a great
      fire, and mad dancing and war whooping. He started toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't go there, pardner," called an old trapper. "Them bucks is crazy
      with drink, an' if I knows anything about Injuns, it won't be no safe
      place for a white man."
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed Longley's last chance for his life! His cries for aid were
      mingled with the savage whoops of his ferocious enemies. Even the people
      living across the river who heard his continued shouts, took them to be
      part of the celebration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maddened by drink and by the ever mounting excitement of their
      incantations, one of the most ghastly deeds ever perpetrated by Indians
      upon the whole river was finished before daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condition of Longley's body upon its discovery roused the entire
      settlement, but the Indians had vanished over the hills and across Bear
      river. The chief had gone home at sundown, and it was as impossible to
      find those who were on the bar that night, as to distinguish one grain of
      sand from another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old pier stands to this day, notwithstanding the fierce battering of
      the floods of nearly seventy years; a monument enduring long after the
      Digger Indians are gone off the face of the earth, as though to
      commemmorate the power of the white race and that member of it who gave up
      his life at its base.

      Grizzley Bob of Snake Gulch

     "Be the battle lost or won,
     Though its smoke shall hide the sun,
     I shall find my love&mdash;the one
     Born for me!"

    &mdash;Bret Harte.

    <p>
      Names of settlements in the '49 days were often as "Rough an Ready" as the
      reasons for their being!
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of them spoke, more or less eloquently, for themselves and no man
      picked by fame in glowing wise from the heterogeneous mass of persons
      could hope to escape a nickname.
    </p>
    <p>
      A miner was discovered roaming down a river bed minus his nether garments,
      and lives to this day in the appellation of Shirt Tail canyon. Two men
      fought. One of them lost an eye in the manner indicated by Gouge Eye.
      Hundreds of wild geese were wont to gather on a sunny mesa above the
      river. It made a splendid level town called Wild Goose Flat. The plains
      were covered with "Antelope." The end gate of a prairie schooner was lost
      on a hill, and Tail Gate mountain came into being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humbug Creek panned light with gold. Red Dog, Hangtown, Round Tent Claims,
      Dry Diggings, Let 'Er Rip, You Bet, Yuba Dam, One Horse Town, and Hell's
      Delight shriek for themselves, or should!
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, is the tale of Grizzley Bob, who mined in Snake Gulch at the
      foot of Bear Mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The bear made straight for me! Old Bull-doze was hangin' onto him below,
      somewhere, but I dropped my Killer (gun) and grabbed my knife, 'cause I
      knew if I didn't get in on him with Slasher it was all up with both of us.
      Bear and I took a tight grip on each other and I hit straight for his
      heart just as he gave me a swipe in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We both fell, the bear on top, and then I didn't remember anything for
      awhile. When I woke I felt something heavy on my stomach, but I couldn't
      see anything for blood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hu-ray!" cheered old Solly Jake, thinking the tale was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sick Jimmy, from behind the bar, prodded him good-humoredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dry up, Soll."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am dry," whimpered old Soll, "I'm dryer'n before I got drunk!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, then," pushing a bottle across the redwood slab used for a bar,
      "the drinks are on Grizzley Bob and Handsome Harry, tonight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it such a big strike they made?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sure was. Go on, Bob," he called to the tall, magnificently built
      young spokesman, "then what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "After awhile I managed to crawl from under that old grizzley and when I'd
      wiped the one good eye that was left, I saw him lying there as stiff and
      dead as a mackerel, with Slasher sticking in his heart clean up to the
      handle. It was pretty near dark then, but the sun was just showing hisself
      over the top of Bear mountain when I got to Rattlesnake Bill's cabin, and
      you'll scarcely believe me but I didn't have enough grit left to signal
      Bill I was there. I just settled down all of a heap-like and that's the
      way they found me. Bill, he got a doctor from Angel's and after awhile I
      pulled out all right, but I ain't been much of a beauty since. Well, what
      th&mdash;," as the door banged open to reveal an exceedingly handsome
      blond youngster dragging in a cringing newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi," he called, while two frolicsome imps danced in his splendid blue
      eyes. "Any of you chaps got a rope handy? Time this fellow was strung up
      over a limb to be a picture for coyotes to bark at!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hall, you let go, there. There'll be no chaffing a tenderfoot whilst I'm
      around and you know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who says so?" laughed Handsome Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My foppish friend," spoke up The Senator, "the reputation of Grizzley Bob
      says so. A reputation that is the terror and admiration of every mining
      camp in the mountains. A dead shot, a sure thing with the knife, a heart
      to succor the oppressed and often to protect the shiftless," acridly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, Senator! Your species of implication is worthy the splendor
      of your mighty apparel. The old swallow-tail retains its pristine glory, I
      perceive, though your other habiliments have one by one yielded to the
      ravages of time, and been replaced by the rough and ready garments of the
      frontier. Perchance&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hall, have I got to make you let go of this pore devil!" Bob's powerful
      figure came forward into the full light of the huge fireplace. One-half
      the face above the comely form was hideously repulsive. It had been
      literally torn away and what remained was so scarred and seamed that it
      scarcely bore any resemblance to a human countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His one remaining eye was large, dark and glowing with kindness as he bent
      over the victim of his partner's latest joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye-ah," drawled old Doc Smithers, precipitating a large mouthful of brown
      liquid into the fireplace. "Bob, he'll pet 'im, an' that ol' bulldog o'
      his'n 'ull lick im, an' next thing we know Bob'll be givin' 'im a claim,
      just like he took in Handsome Harry hisself goin' on two years ago. Look
      at the dandy, struttin'! Bob buys 'im all them fancy togs an' loves to see
      'im wearin' 'em. White hands, an' red cheeks, an' straight nose like a
      gal. Swan, ef he wasn't so ornery an' long-limbed I'd a mind to call 'im
      one. Ef 'twant for his hidin' behind Bob so, I'd&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      What he'd have done was never known, for the whole room-full of prankish,
      loud-voiced, roistering men was suddenly struck dumb by the unwonted sound
      of a lady's voice out in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bull-doze reached her first, Bob next, and Handsome Harry third. She was
      only a slip of a young thing and the fright she got from the kindly rush
      of the old bulldog was immeasurably increased by Bob's frightful
      caricature of a face. She turned, shuddering, to the handsome,
      richly-decked young Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father and mother, sir, are very ill. I was going after a doctor, but
      I am tired out. I can go no further. Oh, could one of you go on to
      Angel's, whilst I rest with some lady of your town?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was apparently speechless from the thrall of her fresh young beauty,
      because it was Bob who answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You certainly can, Miss! Grizzley Bob's word on that. Where'd you come
      from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Roundtree's, sir," timidly. Bob had turned to call orders through
      the open door and the girl gasped as the strong, manly profile of the
      unscarred half of his face was turned toward her. Bull-doze licked her
      white fingers, and she stooped to pat his ugly head so that the long curls
      at her temple might hide her face from the look in Hal's bold eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey, Antelope Bill, saddle that ewe-necked cayuse of yours and vamoose,
      pronto, after the doctor. Plug Hat Pete, you've got the best cabin in
      town. We'll want it for the lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help yourself, Grizzley," answered the gambler. "It is a privilege."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am to stay with Mrs.&mdash;Pete?" asked Becky, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Child, you're a-going to be as safe as if there was a lady in this
      law-evadin' camp; which there isn't, exceptin' your own sweet and lovely
      self."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a-going to have old Bull-doze watchin' inside the cabin and ten
      decent and sober men watchin' outside it and nothin' short of a messenger
      from up-skies could touch one pretty, red-gold curl on your proud little
      head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob, I'll take her home to her mother," spoke up Harry who had never once
      taken his bold gaze from the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you won't take her home to her mother, neither!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beckey was strangely comforted by the protective drawl of the big man's
      voice. Accustomed as she had grown to the rapid transitions of the West,
      she realized the fallacy of her first impression from his appearance. That
      night laid the foundation of her regard for him, which was deeper than a
      mere surface appeal, and which was never to waver.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "H'm," snorted Cornish Jack, shuffling a greasy pack of cards in Sick
      Jimmie's place and watching two men go by, "that's the most willin' pair
      on the gulch! Bob, he's willin' to do all the work, an' Handsome Harry,
      he's willin' to let 'im. Fine house Bob's just built. Must of cost a
      heap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say that Miss Beckey and her mother are going to live in it,"
      answered Plug Hat Pete. "I'll raise you ten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Handsome Harry's bin a-dancin' round that gal ever since they moved here,
      six months ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and the look in her eyes in another direction, is plainly to be
      read." The implication was lost on Cornish Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ol' Bob, he does all he can to throw 'em together. Air ye goin' to the
      house warmin' tonight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said The Senator. "Particularly if we manage to keep old
      Tommy Norton and Black Joe from getting intoxicated, so there will be a
      pair of fiddlers on the gulch. Tommy, on such occasions, always has an
      attack of religion which precludes the possibility of his assisting at any
      profane scene of mirth, and Joe falls into a deep sleep from which nothing
      can rouse him for twenty-four hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Antelope back. I hear his roan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, who do you think I met down around the curve of Blackjack Hill?
      That gal o' Bob's on her pinto and that sneakin' Handsome Harry on his
      black mustang, ridin' full-bent-for-leather!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The men rushed with one accord to Bob's cabin, where he sat before his
      fireless hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We al'ays knew he was a sneakin' thief, but you wouldn't hear nothin'
      agin him. Took all the bags of gold dust from your claim, too, didn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, boys, that isn't fair to call him a thief. He was my partner and
      what was mine was his, and a man has a right to take his own wherever he
      finds it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the gal?" asked a chorus of voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That girl wasn't in any way bound to me, and you can't expect a pretty
      creature like her to care for such a beauty as I am, when there's a fellow
      like Handsome Harry around. It don't stand to reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, fellows," said Poker Bill, "if Bob's satisfied I reckon we ought to
      be. Time to get into our biled shirts for the house warmin', anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to disappoint you, boys, but there won't be a house warming. I
      built it for them and they're gone. It'll stay locked till they come
      again. This old cabin is good enough for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they left him. Bob relit his pipe and settled back on his bench. Once
      he roused a moment to mutter. "But they'd ought to know me better. They
      needn't have run away from their best friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after dark a pinto paced home through the quiet, mourning camp with a
      very weary bulldog at her heels. Beckey slid from her side saddle and
      crept to Bob's open door. By the light of a full moon she could see the
      big lax figure in an attitude of utter despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You! Girl, I thought you'd gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went because&mdash;because I thought you'd come after me. I'd tried
      everything else that a woman can do to make you understand * * * He's
      begged me so many times to run off. When he understood, he was beastly. He
      put me off the horse and told me to walk, then. It was the dog who fought
      him, and then I ran for Pinto and came back." Her low voice failed her,
      but she controlled herself, and went on, "I thought if I pretended to go
      you'd see&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See! Girl, you've known ever since you came creeping into Snake Gulch
      that night that you were the very heart and soul of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," she sobbed, "that is not what I would have you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean&mdash;no, I am a great fool. No woman could bring herself to&mdash;A
      face like mine! Even if you did, it would be from gratitude. I could not
      permit such a sacrifice," he finished, with a touch of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl waited, then when he was silent she turned with a sob to go to
      her mother's cabin. The soft footfalls died away. Bob stood motionless.
      Suddenly a scream rang out on the still night air. Bulldoze scrambled off
      the door-stone with a snarl of battle-rage and charged for the sound, but
      he was easily outdistanced by the huge miner, who ran with the lithe grace
      of an Indian. In an incredibly short time the little form was safe in his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there's a terrible animal in the mining ditch. I heard it! It's
      coming this way! A grizzley, I know!" Bob peered into the ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, girl, it's only drunken old Solly Jake going home holding his jug
      out of the water. He gets into the ditch so he won't lose the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how does he know when to get out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, when he bangs his head on the overbrace of the first flume, he
      knows he's home and crawls out." Bob began gently to withdraw his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you let me go now," she whispered, "I'll wish that it had been a
      grizzley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must take you home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you have! I am home," clinging to him desperately, "I want no other
      in the world than this one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my scarred&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl reached up, drawing down his tall, dark head in her arms. She
      kissed his mutilated cheek, then pressed it tenderly against her soft,
      bare throat. It did not stay long, as Bob felt that such kisess should be
      returned without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hu-ray," cheered Solly Jake, waving his whisky jug, "tale ended right!
      Time f'r 'nother drink, boys!" and standing up to his middle in water he
      proceeded to demonstrate his idea.

      Curley Coppers the Jack
    </h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "On Selby Flat we live in style;
     We'll stay right here till we make our pile.
     We're sure to do it after a while,
     Then good-bye to Californy!"

    &mdash;Canfield's "Diary of a Forty-Niner."
</pre>
    <p>
      The beautiful Casino at Monte Carlo stands in one of the loveliest
      settings on earth. Facing the blue Mediterranean and enhanced by the
      exquisitely kept marble villas of Monaco, it may justly be called the acme
      of gambling institutions. It has become an institution through the years.
      Time has brought it stability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its absolute antithesis were the gambling dens of '49. Built over-night,
      destined to remain if the mines were rich, and to melt away if they
      pinched out, the gambling hells were sometimes the veriest makeshifts.
      Canvas covered, dirt floored, except for the dancing platform, rough
      red-wood bar and tables; surrounded by all the sordidness of Hurdy Gurdy
      town in which fortunes, and reputations, and lives were bid, and shuffled,
      and lost, as indiscriminately as grains of dust blown into the
      ever-changing sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thirst for gold is universal. In those half-mad days of delirious
      seeking, the princeling rubbed sleeves with the scoundrel and the clod,
      and each man's ability was his only protection. Fortune played no
      favorites. The tale is told of the judge who drove home in his coach
      through a shallow creek. Ruin faced him for the lack of a few thousand
      dollars. He took out his derringer and shot himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not half an hour later a Chinaman crossed the creek under his pole between
      two swinging baskets. He found a nugget there which brought him over
      $30,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, is the tale of what Fortune did to Curly Gillmore.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "Whoop-ee! Ki-yi-ee hick-ee! Yi-ee-ee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There comes Curly," said Teddy Karns, "never altering the steady flow of
      the whiskey he was pouring into a tin cup for Sailor Jack to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Made a big strike, I hear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yea-ah. About $25,000, they say. Might be a million, the way the female
      critters run," Ted laughed, as the hurdy-gurdy girls with shrieks of
      laughter pounced upon the noisy newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, hel-lo, Nance, and Liz, and Babe, and Bouncin' Bet, old gal! All
      ready to help me sling it, ain't you? But where's little pale Alice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Allie? She's back in the tents. Sick tonight. Awful bad, she's took.
      She'll be shufflin' off 'fore long, an' rid o' mortal misery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little soldier!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweet, she was, an' born to be good. Why, I remember (we came 'round the
      Horn on the same sailin' vessel) that they wasn't a ailin' baby on board
      but what Allie could get a smile out of it, nor a sick soul that didn't
      bless 'er for 'er kindness an' care. Sick o' body, sick o' heart, Allie
      did for 'em all, bless 'er."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was happy, then," put in Babe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Comin' out to Californy to 'er lover, she were, all her folks back
      in the States bein' dead. She'd took care of 'er mother, last. 'Twas why
      'er man came on ahead. An' when she got here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw-w, Bet, don't you cry," said Babe. "Y' see, when we got here, Curly,
      we found her boy'd been shot in a fight over a mine. Allie, she hadn't no
      money left, and no gumption much, like Bet an' me, to fight her way, so we
      took 'er along o' us. We tried to keep her the little lady that she was,
      but&mdash;Well, we got snowed in last winter up on the divide an'&mdash;Faro
      Sam&mdash;Well, it broke her pure heart, an' most Bet's an' mine, too. An'
      she ain't never got over the cold she took, up there in the snow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life's hard for a girl anyways you put it, an' she'll be happier over the
      river where there ain't no cold nor sorrer. Bet! Aw-w, she'll sleep on a
      finer bed nor you an' I could give 'er, an' wake happy, with ever'one she
      loved best around her. She's layin' there so white an' small an' still
      it'd most break your hear to see 'er. Like a little snowdrop you've
      picked, an' worn, an' slung away. So gentle&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what's this, anyway? A wake?" broke in Faro Sam's icy voice. "Do I
      hire fiddlers to play a funeral dirge? Get on with you," scattering the
      girls in the direction of the card tables and the dancing platform. "Which
      ones do you want, Curly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want Babe and Betsy. Where's that little pale printer's devil, the one
      they call the gambler's ghost? I know Sam won't let you girls leave here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's workin' up on the paper, I guess. They ran out of coal oil and had
      to fire up with pine knots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's comin, now. He ain't no gambler's ghost tonight, though; he's pot
      black!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ghost," said Curly, "you take this around to Allie." It was a $50
      octagonal slug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yessir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you say that there's more, all she wants, where that comes from."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yessir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, shaking his mop of brown, curly hair as though to relieve his head
      of a burden, he took the girls for what he felt was a much-needed round of
      drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      By midnight the place was wild!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sam," shouted Curly, "what's the limit on your pesky old game?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ceiling's the limit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll put up one bet! Bein' on Easy Street I was goin' back to the
      States to marry my girl, but I'm blamed if I don't put up my swag for one
      turn of the cards."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent for his "dust," and piled the long, buckskin bags criss-cross
      before Faro Sam's table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll copper the jack, gentlemen," he shouted. "All on the jack!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Teddy Karn's face turned a pasty hue, and the tip of his tongue slid along
      his puffed lips, but the lines of Faro Sam's face never changed, and his
      eyes retained the blank impassivity of a snake's as he slipped his cards.
      There was a sudden, tense silence. The girls pressed forward with hurried
      breathing and the men waited, rigid as stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody's mongrel paced to the middle of the platform and scratched for
      fleas, with soft thumping on the floor. That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a man swore! A woman's voice shrilled hysterically! Faro Sam rose
      to his feet ceremoniously. "The house is yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jinks!" yelled Curly, "I've coppered the jack! I've broken the bank!
      I've&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the doors swung open quietly. Silence dropped once more, with the
      speed of tropical night, upon the blare of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gambler's ghost stood there silhouetted against the light from a log
      fire outside. There were pink streaks down his dirty face, washed by
      tears, and his young shoulders drooped woefully. The dog came forward and
      licked his twitching fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allie is dead," he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curly, I should like to apply for the position of dealer over at your
      place, which yesterday was my place," said Faro Sam, next day at noon,
      meeting Curly on the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, you can have it, Sam. Too bad it's the custom for the house to go,
      too, when somebody breaks the bank. I've turned it over to George
      Spellman, with a thousand to start with. He and I come from the same place
      back in the States. Great friends we were, till we both got to sparkin'
      the same girl. When she took me, George, he got pretty ornery, but I guess
      he's all over it by this time. I'm goin' home to marry her, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've just been around to the tents seein' about little Allie's funeral,
      an' he'll keep on the girls, too. I'm pullin' my freight for Hangtown
      (Placerville). This town's a little too small for a fellow of my means."
    </p>
    <p>
      Faro Sam looked after him with a cynical light in his narrow eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The pot bubbles loudest when the water's nearest the bottom," he
      muttered, and turned to pick a fastidious way through the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life that night in the gambling hell went on much as usual. Teddy Karns
      "poured the rye," and Faro Sam "slipped the cards," whilst Babe worried
      over Bouncing Bet's intoxicated condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Allie, you know," Babe confided to Red Shirt Pete at midnight. "She
      took it awful hard, and Spellman, the new boss, wouldn't let 'er off
      tonight. I bin tellin' 'er Allie's better off, but she won't listen to
      nobody. She's just bin pourin' 'em down all evenin'. What's that?" at a
      loud banging on the doors. Some one opened them and Curly rode into the
      place on the handsome horse he had bought that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, boys, I'm cleaned! Tried to copper the jack in Hangtown and the
      whole $50,000 went. George, I'll be askin' for this place back, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This place belongs to me, Curly Gillmore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who says so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This old lady says so," covering him with his pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curly laughed, not too musically. "Well, boys, what am I bid for this
      horse? I need a grubstake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Play you for him," said Faro Sam, laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done," said Curly. A moment later he laughed once more and swung down off
      the Spanish thoroughbred. "He's yours. Well, good-night, boys."
    </p>
    <p>
      No one answered. He had, like Hadji the beggar, become in twenty-four
      hours again a drifter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babe sneaked out after him. "Here, Curly," she slipped her hand into her
      bosom and held out the octagonal slug. "When Bet an' I reached Allie last
      night she was holdin' it in her little dead hand, an' there was such a
      smile on her face! You gave her that happy smile. God bless you for it!
      Now, you take this&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Curly turned away, blinking his eyes, and trying to swallow the lump
      in his throat. Babe stood watching him through her tears as he tramped
      down the street, out of the town on the road to the south.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Two years later in a hall in Sonora, a man strolled in to the card tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, hel-lo, Curly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Curly glanced up briefly. "Hello, George."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear you've made another strike."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can hear a lot that ain't true. This happens to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, I was telling&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the sight of you don't put me in the mood to be told much." There
      was an imperceptible shifting of the crowd around the table. They were
      moving away from Spellman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was telling my wife&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My girl, you mean! It wasn't enough to keep my business, you had to go
      home an' marry my girl, too, didn't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curly, for the love of heaven&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take your hand off my arm, Pete. I'm going to kill this&mdash;. He's not
      the kind of man I thought he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two shots crashed in the room!
    </p>
    <p>
      Spellman wavered through the smoke haze, then dropped his pistol and fell
      slowly across the card table littered with shining cards and poker chips.
      An overturned tallow-dip dropped in a pool of wine and rolled down against
      the dead man's cheek, dabbling it with the color which would never return
      to it again.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "Bet, ain't that Curly Gillmore that we knew three years ago at Coloma,
      when Allie died?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must be a-gittin' blind! Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The feller all dressed up an' walkin' with the lady. Sure it is! Hi,
      Curly, hel-lo! It's Babe. Well, ain't I glad&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman with Curly fixed Babe with a stony glare. "If you wish to
      converse with this... woman, kindly do so when your wife is not
      accompanying you," she said to him in an angry undertone, and went
      majestically on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll come back, Babe. We've been married just a month and she doesn't
      understand. I'll be back later," and he hurried off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bet, did you see who that was with Curly? His wife, he said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw-w, Babe, don't you fret! I guess we fill our little place out here in
      Californy near as much as some o' the fine ladies do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't care. No, I was thinkin' that the ways o' the Lord are curious.
      That lady used to be married to George Spellman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' Curly shot him, down at Sonora, last year!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye-aw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll be&mdash;."

      The Race of the Shoestring Gamblers
    </h2>
    <h3>
      VIII
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Judge not too idly that our toils are mean,
     Though no new levies marshall on our green;
     Nor deem too rashly that our gains are small,
     Weighed with the prizes for which heroes fall."

    &mdash;Bret Harte.
</pre>
    <p>
      If dancing was the first form of amusement to emanate from prehistoric
      savagery, then racing must surely have come next. It may possibly have
      come first. However, we shall leave the "theorizin"' to be settled by the
      lips of the first mummy whose centuries-old tissues shall be roused to
      full life by modern science. What has science not achieved? We have gone
      beyond wonder. We can only believe, and become blase!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime there is still enough red blood in the modern effete productions
      of humans to enjoy a contest of stress and strain, and brain and brawn,
      and to gamble upon the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the '49 days, racing was one of the most popular forms of chance, and
      it often reverted in bizarre tangents. This, then, is what happened at a
      golden fiesta during the week of races:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweet Lady, are all my importunities to be in vain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must confess that I can not bring my mind to a decision, Mr. Saul,"
      answered Mistress Patty Laughton, blushing and curtsying prettily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is surely not for your lack of worldly goods that you hesitate,"
      persisted Slick-heels Saul. "As for what your father is owing me, it
      shall, at the moment of your acceptance, be wiped entirely from the
      books."
    </p>
    <p>
      Patty was incensed at the hint of insolence in the gambler's allusion to
      her improvident father's financial condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me, Mr. Saul," she said, with spirit, "no ulterior motive for
      worldly advancement has the power to coerce my afflections."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you will consider my proposition of marriage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Patty's honest gaze encountered the appraising glint in the coot grey eyes
      of the foppish scape-grace before her. She lowered her own eys quickly to
      hid a hunted look in their dark depths as she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, after the week of races, you shall have your answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then I shall give up my present means of gaining a livelihood, and,
      repairing to San Francisco, shall enter into a profession more fitting the
      social station of the lady who is to become my wife." He bowed deeply and
      withdrew, leaving Patty with a sad face and tearfilled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she straightened her tall figure resolutely. "I must not give way
      to tears. I can not! I will not! There must be some way to pay my father's
      debts beside this extremity, to which death is almost preferable. There is
      still a week's time. A week&mdash;only a week." Panic overwhelmed her, and
      when someone gently took her hand, she cried aloud in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Sweetheart, do I frighten you so? I waited long upon the mesa near
      the speed-track at the spot we had agreed upon, and when you did not come
      I fared forth to meet you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eric, it is Saul again. What can I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, I have about $2000 which I am resolved to play on the races. I will
      win. I must. Old Irish Mike has brought over his whole stableful of saddle
      horses and I was raised in Kentucky. Do not despair, we shall beat the
      gambler at his own game. Here is Mike, now. Perhaps&mdash;Mike, it's a
      fine string of horses you've picked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so. Many a thoroughbred I've bought that came all the way from
      Kentucky or Missouri. All that had the stamina to get to Californy, the
      one thing left that many of the poor devils could sell when they reached
      the coast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mike, some of them are faster than others, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis what half the shoe-string gamblers in the camp have tried to find
      out. I may have me own opinion, but it's to meself I'll kape it till
      afther the races are run. I will not spile sport. Have ye seen the last
      cayuse that's bein' put in?
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean the cow pony that came in with the bunch of cattle from the Napa
      Valley yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same. The auld boy, whilst in his cups, is bettin' she can beat
      anythin' on four legs, even jack rabbits an' antelope. The precious
      gamblin' riff-raff are fillin' him up with tanglefoot, proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mike?" Mike glanced at the silent girl and then down into the gulch
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Patty, have ye visited the claims?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but I should like to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, then, if ye will so pleasure an old man. The men will not be
      workin' tomorrow. They will be that pleased to show a lady how to wash a
      pan o' dirt, they will be saltin' ivery pan wit' nuggets for ye! Eric,
      lad," he called back to the tall young man, "ye might look the cow horse
      over. She has not been curried for long; yet, whisper, beauty is but skin
      deep an' the finest rapier is often encased in a rusty scabbard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something going forward that Mike wishes me to see," though
      Eric, as he hurried off to the livery stable. "That is why he took Patty
      away."
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowd of gamblers were just putting up a pair of riders on two horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey, Eric Tallman, you used to own this horse. Can he beat this
      rat-tailed kyoodle that runs after steers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Eric laid a hand fondly on the magnificent black "half breed," who had
      just enough mustang to give him the stamina and spirit and wildness
      characteristic of the Spanish-bred horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep him on a steady rein and he'll beat anything in the mountains. I'd
      never have sold him except&mdash;." He sighed, turning to the cattle
      horse. She was long necked, long legged, long haired, wall-eyed, lean, and
      badly in need of currying, and yet Irish Mike was no fool, and Mike knew
      Eric's extremity&mdash;his and the girl's whom he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noted the deep, broad chest, the tapering barrel and the tremendous
      driving power in the steel muscles of the hind quarters, but she drooped,
      spiritless. He turned again to the satin-coated half-breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any dust up yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye-aw, about ten thousand. Old fool seems to be well heeled. We've got
      'im full to the eyes, down at String-halt Eddie's place, an' the boys are
      goin' to try the plugs out before they put up any more." Two trial races
      were ridden and the sad cow horse was outrun with apparent ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning as Patty went on her daily stroll to "take the air," her
      way was blocked by a clamoring crowd of undesirables who were baiting a
      miserable old cattle man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell ye, gentlemen, I was indisposed. 'Twas the liquor talking. Surely
      you would not take advantage of a poor old man and his honest,
      hard-working little mount. Every day of her life she works. Gentlemen, I
      beg you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begging will get you nothing better than a good drubbing, you filthy
      cattle lout! If you don't pay up your bets, we'll take it out of your
      hide. I, for one, have a special use for my money at the week's end."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Slick-heels Saul. Patty turned aside, sick at heart. This was the
      creature in whose power she was "like to fall."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon her return she found the old cowboy sitting dejectedly under a
      liveoak bush. "Sir," she began timidly, "you are in trouble. I should like
      to express my sympathy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose with suspicious nimbleness. "Now, bless your kind heart, Miss, to
      stop to console a sad old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I overheard what Mr. Saul said to you, sir. He is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without doubt, without doubt, he is everything you mention. Could you,
      now, be Mistress Patty Laughton, of Kentucky?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew your Grandfather Laughton, my child, and since I came here I have
      heard-of you," he finished, with innate delicacy. Indeed, who had not
      heard her story?
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her silken reticule and drew forth a small, buckskin bag. "Will
      you not accept it? Yesterday, at the claims, I panned it out myself. I am
      sorry for your plight. I am sorry for anyone in the clutches of
      Slick-heels Saul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;. Can you&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does not matter. Your extremity is greater than mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking after the slim girl who carried her head so high. "How
      like a Kentucky Laughton. Thoroughbred stock, all!" He tossed the bag in
      his hand. "'Tis why they are where they are today." Then his keen old eyes
      softened. "And why they are what they are, today. Bless her tender heart
      to stoop to an old cattle man in the mire. As for this&mdash;I must see
      Irish Mike," and he hurried off with surprising speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bets rose. Every gambler had been apprised of the sure thing and flocked
      to the betting like bears to a honey tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have ye put up ye'r money, Eric?" asked Irish Mike, late the next night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Eric, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah. So." Mike's shrewd gave slid from the young man's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They do say that Slick-heels Saul is beginnin' to worry over the $20,000
      he's staked. The shoestring gang have gathered in the information fr'm th'
      express agent that the auld cattle man owns a big Spanish grant down in
      the valley, and has $50,00 to his credit in certificates of deposit from
      the express company. 'Tis as good as gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mike, have you ever seen him before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never spile sport, me boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the last day of the fiesta and the famous race was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is the old cattle man with his vaqueros."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, they're a tough lookin' lot, all armed with a brace o' Colts
      apiece. 'Tis fun they'd have, cleanin' out a Fandango House."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patty, girl, you are pale today."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Eric, 'tis the last day of grace. Heaven help us if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See, Patty, gir-r-rl, they're fixin' for the foot race between Cherokee
      Bob an' that Australian squirt fr'm Sacramento."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are they placing men with guns every ten feet along the track?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Indian can beat the Australian, but he thried to sell the boys out,
      an' if he slackens his gait by ever so little, the b'ys will begin
      shootin' sthraight before them. An' maybe afther the race, he'd better be
      runnin' right on into the next county."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next is a jackass fight, an' then, the race!"
    </p>
    <p>
      After the billigerent jacks had been led away, Red Pete suddenly took to
      the brush, accelerated by a fusillade of bullets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Welchin' his bets, he is, an' ivery man he owes is lettin' him have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nary a hit!" wailed old Jack Horner. "The shootin' in this camp is
      a-gittin' vile! Time we was quittin so d&mdash;&mdash; much pick handlin,
      an' a-practicin' up. It's a reflection on the community. Why, there ain't
      been a Chinaman drilled with a bullet decent an' clean for weeks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're leading out the horses! Where did that little nigger jockey come
      from? The mare's got more ginger today."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eric, surely your horse can win!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must! He must, or&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slick-heels Saul's face is turnin' the color of me native isle," chuckled
      Irish Mike. "Patty, me little ladybird, 'tis no time to be faintin'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you can't know&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, an' I know more than you t'ink. Bear up, Asthore, the darkest hour
      is just forninst the dawn. Whisht, now! They're off!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here they come! The black is ahead! See, the nigger is lying flat on the
      mare's neck. She's closing up! Oh, they are neck and neck! I cannot look.
      Eric&mdash;The black is getting the whip. Good horse! They are even again!
      Ah, it is only for a moment. The mare... is over the line, first... It is
      all ended, life, love, honor, happiness... I cannot belong to that man! My
      poor old father. Dear old... for his sake, I must. I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patty, girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eric, you are not to blame. You would wager on your own horse. 'Tis but
      natural. I must accept my fate with what fortitude I can summon. Please
      take me home. All the people staring. I cannot bear it long."
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Slick-heels Saul pressed forward to her side at the
      boarding-house steps, she was as stately and cold as the snow-hooded rocks
      of Granite Mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have lost everything, but still I hold you to your promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I made no promise, sir," she said haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But you will," he answered meaningly, "tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand aside!" thundered Eric.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come awn," soothed Irish Mike. "Not with the lady here, Eric, b'y."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patty, I cannot let you go! I will shoot the beast on sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would not vindicate my father's honor. Hush, he is coming. I must
      remember that I am a Laughton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eric turned to stare moodily out the dusty window. "There goes the cattle
      man with his followers and his strong-box. What he must have won! Here
      comes Mike. In a hurry, too! I wonder&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Slick-heels Saul was bowing before the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive an auld Irishman for intrudin' upon so tender a scene&mdash;"
      (Slick-heels glared at him malevolently), "but I have he-e-re a something
      for Mistress Patty Laughton," pretending to read the inscription on the
      package he held out, "from the auld boy, there, who is just leavin' us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bread cast upon the waters of sweet charity shall be returned an hundred
      fold. Blessed are the pure in heart for they are of the children of God,'
      he has written. Why, it is money!" gasped Patty, "and such a large
      amount!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had me put up ye'r little bag o' gold on his mare. These are y'er
      winnings." Mike smiled inwardly at the sum of money. "Sure, auld Andy must
      have put a rock or two in the wee buckskin bag," he thought, but aloud he
      said, "I never spile sport, an' I could not tell ye before, but 'tis auld
      Andy Magee an' his famous racin' mare, the fastest quarter mile horse
      bechune the state of Missouri and the Pacific ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis the same game he's pulled on the gamblin' crooks all the way from
      the Oregon line to Mariposa in the south. Even gettin' filled wit'
      tanglefoot is part of the dodge. They cannot touch him an' the vaqueros
      protect him fr'm the shootin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what about the tryout?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Also in the schame. The mare was cross-shod; meanin', two of her shoes,
      the near front, an' the off hind wans, were twice as heavy as the others
      She could not run top speed in th'm f'r love nor gold. Yesterday she was
      shod in light racin' pads, an' under her own jockey. No horse on the coast
      could catch her. An' always, the smart racin' gamblers play th' auld man
      for a fool. Such is often the end of greed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pay up the dad's gamblin' debts, an' bid this Knight o 'the Green Cloth a
      swate an' long fare-ye-well. Then go an' be happy, me child."

     "Which I wish to remark,
     And my language is plain,
     That for ways that are dark
     And for tricks that are vain,
     The heathen Chinee is peculiar,
     Which the same I would rise to explain."

    &mdash;Bret Harte.
</pre>
    <p>
      Certain learned archaeologists maintain that there are marked racial
      similarities between the American Indians and the Chinese&mdash;physical
      characteristics dating from unknown centuries, when the widely sundered
      continents were probably one.
    </p>
    <p>
      However that may be, in the days of gold in California the greatest
      animosity existed between the Indians and the Chinamen. The feeling began,
      presumably, through intermarriage and flourished like the celebrated
      milkweed vine of the foothills, which has been known to grow&mdash;I quote
      a '49er, now dead, which is perhaps taking an advantage&mdash;12 inches in
      a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tale is told of a Chinaman crossing a suspension footbridge, high over
      a winter torrent, from one part of a mining camp to another. An Indian ran
      to meet him. John Chinaman started back as quickly as he could on the
      swaying bridge. The faster Indian caught him, and, though miners on both
      shores sought to save the unfortunate "Chink" by a rain of bullets, it was
      too long range, and the Indian threw him to certain death in the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Indians did not always win, and this, then, is the tale of an
      encounter between Hop Sing and Digger Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a game which held accountin', On an old Sierra mountain&mdash;"
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "Whassa malla, to-o much nail-o ketchem clo'e (clothes)?" snorted Hop
      Sing, coming around to the side verandah with two pins in his hand, to
      where Miss Jo Halstead was embroidering an antimacassar in bright
      worsteds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Sing, did you hurt your hand?" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Nother boy heap mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another boy? Aren't you doing the washing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No do. Me&mdash;" but Jo had gone to the back yard. She found the tallest
      Chinaman she had ever seen, meekly bending to the washing, and quickly
      obeying the sharp orders rained upon his queue-circled poll by Hop Sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;Sing," protested Jo, stifling any sort of smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Him no good! No got place! Me pay one-dollar-hop him stop one month,
      Chinee house. He no pay. Me makem work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but&mdash;what is that? Those are shots on the stage road over the
      hill! Oh, it must be another holdup! And Rand is shotgun messenger on the
      stage today. Hark! Hear the horses running! They're coming&mdash;fast.
      They're trying to make the town!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ketchem, more horse run behind," answered Sing, listening intently, his
      slanting eyes glittering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sing, you go and see what&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can do! You get that boy, make 'em wash, alle same. He no good! You look
      see?" Joe turned to spy the frightened deputy washerman wriggling under
      the verandah. "Bime-by I kill 'um," remarked Sing, composedly. "No got
      time now. Missie Jo, wagon come, maybeso better you stop house-o."
    </p>
    <p>
      Six horses topped the long hill, pulling the huge rockaway stage. They
      were coming at full speed, and the near wheeler was dripping with blood. A
      dead man hung over the high dashboard, where his feet had caught when he
      fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning far out over the team was a young man holding the reins in one
      hand, while he lashed the shot-crazed horses to their last ounce of speed
      with the fifteen-foot whip. His sawed-off shotgun lay on the seat beside
      him. It was Rand!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank God!" moaned Joe, but in another moment, "Poor old Salt Peter!
      They must have killed him when he wouldn't stop. Sing&mdash;" but Hop Sing
      had vanished, leaving only his white apron across the wash bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the stage thundered around the turn at the end of the main street, the
      wounded horse threw up his head, coughed bloody spume over the pointers
      (the second pair), and fell. Men were already scrambling onto their
      horses, and loping in from all directions. Rand cut out a buckskin leader,
      mounted, and dashed frantically back up the road followed by a dozen
      horsemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rand, who was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, exactly. Thought I saw Digger Dan&mdash;" They were over
      the hill, and Jo heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hop Sing did not turn up for supper, but his tall substitute did fairly
      well, and Jo did not worry. Some time after dark, a weary Rand appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Miss Jo, we got Digger Dan. At least we thought it was, but he
      won't say a word except that he wants to see you. I've come to escort you
      over to the jail. Will you trust yourself to me that far?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That far, yes," archly, "'tis but a short space." Not for worlds would
      she have him guess her anxiety of the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish that 'twere for always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can Digger Dan want of me," she evaded, thankful for the darkness
      which hid her blushes. "Rand, hear the wolves howling!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are only coyotes, dear&mdash;Miss Joe, and afraid to venture into
      town except to the chicken roosts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it's Hop Sing!" exclaimed Jo, upon first sight of the prisoner.
      "They've cut off half his queue and braided his hair in two pig tails, and
      put different clothes on him, and he does look like an Indian. How very
      extraordinary!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kethem Digger Dan cloe," blazed Sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a likely tale," said the sheriff, "betcha he knows more about
      stage robbin' than he'll let out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure he does not about this one. He was with me every moment."
      Nevertheless, she could not help remembering the substitute Chinaman whom
      Sing had put in to do his washing. But, though the complex Oriental nature
      will never be quite understood by the Occidental, she had confidence in
      the loyalty of the Chinaman, who had served them for five years, and whose
      life had once been saved by her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah Sing, will you tell me what happened," she asked, knowing well that a
      command would only elicit a stolid "No savvey." Put as a favor, or a
      confidence, he might respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Him Digger Dan, no good! He stealem me clo'e. Ketchem. Missa Land (Rand)
      an' plenty man come, he lun (run). I ketchem him! Tlee (three) lobber
      (robber) come. To-o muchee men. I no can fight! He&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They tied him on a horse and drove it down the canyon for us to follow,
      while they got away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, he knows more about it than he's telling!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so, sheriff," said Rand, positively. The man turned to him,
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me go home, all same Missie Joe?" Hop Sing raised an expressionless face
      and glared at the broad belt of the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can go, but I'm going to keep an eye on you and see that your
      apron's hanging in the Halstead's kitchen every day of your heathen life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Later that night when Rand started home, strange incantations were going
      on in Sing's lean-to. In four china bowls punk was burning, and an old
      Chinaman was muttering weird invocations over the clothes of Digger Dan
      slowly smouldering in a coal-oil can in the middle of the floor. Hop Sing
      held one hand in the smoke, raised the other aloft and made a
      blood-curdling oath of some sort which, by the expression of his face,
      probably consigned the owner forever more to the nethermost depths 'of
      Tophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, where is Ali Sing?" asked Jo the next morning, when she found the
      tall slave still in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He got heap sick cousin. He go way. I stay. He come back bime-by." Jo
      knew that it was useless to question further.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer drifted by and still Sing did not return. Rand walked in one
      day with the first flurry of snow, from his claim in the south. He caught
      both of Jo's hands in his without a word, kissed them tenderly and let
      them go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rand," she faltered, "it is so long since I've heard from you. You have
      been acting so strangely-for months!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jo, have you not heard the talk that has been whispered with my name ever
      since Sing disappeared? They say that I know too much about the holdups;
      that I helped the Chinaman to escape; that Digger Dan and Hop Sing are
      one; that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not listen to such falsehoods," cried the girl, her grey eyes
      flashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You blessed little woman! But considering this, how can I say to you what&mdash;tell
      you that which glorifies the very life in my frame. How can I offer you a
      name tarnished by the suspicions of my fellow men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rand, I acknowledge no such allegations. Oh, I may be lost to all sense
      of womanly reserve, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When my name is cleared, I shall hope to enter Paradise. Till then I must
      not. I cannot bring disgrace upon you. I shall return to my old post of
      shotgun messenger&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rand! No! Listen to me one moment. Last evening Digger Dan came to this
      very place. He told me that if you went back to the stage you would
      certainly be killed. They have been robbing all summer. It is said that
      Joaquin is in the mountains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, they are Tom Bell's men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo glanced up, startled. "Whoever it is, has sent you a warning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miz Halstead," called a strident voice, "th' stage's jest in, an' you're
      paw's took awful sick up on the Middle Fork, at his mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have to go on the morning stage. Will you not please&mdash;" to
      Rand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jo, I do not fear death. It is dishonor that maddens me, for your sake.
      The snows have come. They are already fitting runners to the stages. The
      mails and the 'dust' must get through in spite of all. I go out on the
      first sleigh; this one you must take. This winter I shall vindicate my
      name, if it is humanly possible to do so." He kissed the end of one long
      curl of her hair, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some weeks later, during a lull between storms, Rand's face lit up with
      the feeling which but one woman in the world could inspire, as the stage
      pulled in to Middle Fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father is not quite recovered, but I thought it best to get him out
      before we were snowed in. Rand, Digger Dan came," she added, in a whisper;
      "the stage will be stopped today. Yet, it is gathering for a storm. I dare
      not stay. What shall I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along. I will protect you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two miles further, as they topped a hill, Texas, the driver, pulled the
      laboring six far to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" asked Rand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cut, there," answered Texas, "an' it's piled high with a drift."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out for stumps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got 'em spotted," muttered Tex.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" swinging his gun quickly to the right. The horses plunged,
      snorting, quickly to the left, the sleigh hit a snow-covered stump, and it
      was only Tex's expert driving that saved it from overturning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some animal. I saw his hide." A hide Rand had seen, but it was the
      coyote-skin coat of an Indian who had made one sign and instantly
      vanished. Very quickly the dreaded halt came.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out, Tex! There's a rifle barrel from behind that tree trunk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Halt!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Halt it is. There's nothing we can do." Was it Jo's presence in the stage
      below that made him give in without a struggle, or did he know that the
      Wells-Fargo box had vanished from under the driver's seat? Or was it
      knowledge of the horde of yelling Indians which rose from the snowy brush,
      and swooped down upon the shooting robbers? Four of them were brought, in
      triumph, to the town on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the express box?" asked the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know," answered Rand, defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cached away up on the mountain, I suppose, where the others are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!" thundered Rand, "I have brought in, the bandits, as I promised, to
      clear my own namen&mdash;all but Digger Dan, who escaped. When I say that
      I do not know what happened to the box, you will please understand that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here comes Digger Dan now, carrying something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No Indian ever carried anything in baskets slung on a pole!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hel-lo, Missie Jo, how you do?" blandly remarked Digger Dan's double.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hop Sing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ketchem Missa Land's money, nis bas-a-kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's in the other one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nat one, lock (rock). Makern heap easy carry-em."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you get the box?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You savvey place him horse get scare; him wagon, he fa' over top-side
      down. Him money, he fa' out. Him stop place snow melt away by heap big
      tlee tlunk. Me see. Missa Land, I know he like. I ketchem."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Rand took Jo home they were met by a smiling Sing in a snowy white
      apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's the other boy?" asked Jo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Him boy? I tellum get out quick, or I killum, sure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah Sing, how can I ever thank you for all the six months you've spent in
      the brush?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He all-li, Massa Land. You ketchem me come out nat jail. I heap savvey
      you come see Missie Jo. Missie papa, lo-ong time now, he ketchee me no
      die. Missie Jo, alla same my girl-o."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those Indians&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were Sing's friends, dear, dressed up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chinamen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sing, where did Digger Dan go to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He go hell," remarked Sing, pleasantly. "He lun away to Oustamah (Indian
      village). Me ketchum. Alla squaw ketchern plenty tar on head, makern big
      cly (cry, Indian word for wake). Me killum him. Goo-bye, me go cookem
      velly fine dinner. Missie Jo, Massa Land, you get marry now. Me hope you
      ketchem plenty boy!" From his point of view what greater blessing could he
      wish them? Later, he peeked in curiously from the kitchen, but, as kisses
      are not included in the Chinese curriculum, he failed to be interested and
      returned to his baking.

      The Barstow Lynching

     "This is my story, sir; a trifle, indeed, I assure you.
     Much more, perchance, might be said&mdash;
          but I hold him of all men most lightly
     Who swerves from the truth in his tale. No, thank you

    <p>
      Contests of every sort were the order of the day in '49. Any ferocious
      encounter which would promulgate betting was countenanced, and even
      encouraged. There were dog fights, bull fights, bobcat or mountain lynx
      fights, and fights between game chickens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tale is even told of cootie fights during long, rainy winter evenings
      which must be spent indoors. The harborers of the contestants simply
      reached under their shirts, drew forth a doughty grey-backed warrior,
      placed him on a child's slate which was used as an arena, and the fight
      was on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A camp named Lousy Level is said to have made a specialty of this sort of
      battle. Thousands of dollars were sometimes bet upon the outcome.
      Arguments arising from various combats often developed into robbing,
      murdering and lynching. This, then, is the tale of a certain lynching.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "Step up, gents. Only a dollar to see the big fight. One little dollar to
      view the greatest contest of the age. See the champion fighting jackass of
      the state vanquish the biggest grizzly in the Sierra mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The unconquerable battling jackass who has whipped two bulls down at
      Sonora, and caused a mountain lion to turn tail. Step up, gents. Only a
      dollar to get inside the ropes," and Webfoot Watson waved a well-kept hand
      toward the arena. It was a pine-staked palisade, bound around the top with
      rawhide thongs. At one end, the "champion donk" was tethered, and at the
      other the "fiercest grizzly" was confined in a stout cage of solid planks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Step in, gents! There are logs and stumps to stand on. The show will
      begin immediately. We are now loosing the lion-eating jack. He&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey!" roared Swipe-eye Weller, pointing to the laden trees outside the
      enclosure, "ef you think I'm agoin' to pay a dollar for this here show
      jest because I ain't no tree-climbin' animal, you're pickin' out the wrong
      customer. They coughs up a screamer apiece, or this act don't begin
      actin'. That's final!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing loath, Webfoot claimed the penalty from the crowd perched in the
      trees, in some instances not without the aid of his six-shooter, and the
      jack was then turned loose in the palisade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's eatin' grass," piped up old Grease-top Jamie. "Say, I can see twenty
      jackasses eatin', down to the boardin' house at Blue Tent any day, an' I
      don't have to pay no dollar, neither. Turn out ye'r baar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi! Here he comes! Eat 'im up, jack! Why, that ain't no grizzly.
      Sufferin' stars, he's only a little scared cinnamon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's goin' after mister-old-donk, though."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye-aw. Lookin' fer protection. Hey, look at the donk landin' kicks on 'is
      ribs. Ride 'im baar! Claw 'im up! Give 'im&mdash;" but the little cinnamon
      bear reached the fence in three jumps, scaled it, and took to the
      grease-wood thickets in record time in spite of the yells and bullets of
      the disgruntled spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webfoot had made even better time than the bear, and only the placid jack
      remained as a memento of the occasion. He was taken at the head of a long
      procession of miners and made the occasion for a call upon the whole round
      of fandango houses, and dispensaries of liquid rowdyism in the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Partners, aren't you getting somewhat rough with the little fellow?"
      asked a young man in unimpeachable black broadcloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it's Anthony Barstow! Look at the purple raiment! Man, you must have
      struck pay dirt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, thank you, my claim has turned out to be a rich one. What will you
      take for the donk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help yourself. He's a maverick. What's that? Dog fight? Sic 'im, Rover!"
      and the fickle and drink-befuddled mob hurried off down the street to the
      newest excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony took half an apple from his pocket. "I was saving it for tomorrow,
      but do you think you could manage it, Little Pard?" The long ears lifted
      at once, and the soft hairy muzzle took the delicacy daintily out of his
      fingers. Anthony petted him and sauntered on, into the best of the
      gambling halls. He seated himself at a table presided over by a woman
      dealer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, it is not permitted zat ze gamblair shall play," she told him
      courteously, with a flash of very beautiful white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho! Ho! Barstow," roared Copper-down Hicks. "That's one on you! The
      madam, here, sees your brand new togs and thinks you tickle the green
      cloth for a livin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is monsieur's toilette zat 'ave cause ze mistake. I have now better
      observe he's face. He is welcome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think your friend can sit in, though," observed Champer-down,
      grinning broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony turned. The donkey had followed him in, and was standing just
      behind his chair, head hanging, ears lopping, lethargic patience showing
      in every contour of his shaggy body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have consorted with many of his kind," said Anthony, smiling, "and I
      prefer his frank sincerity, his bravery under stress, his worldly poise,
      his calm exterior, which does conceal the fiery depths of his nature; in
      fact, all his so-called animal attributes I prefer, to the more
      sophisticated allure of his human gender." Anthony laid a strong hand on
      the little beast's shoulder, while the French woman regarded him curiously
      out of long black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, take that, you good for nothing cur," and a man kicked a dog in
      through the door, to lie in a twisted, bloody heap upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, you brute!" called Anthony, springing upon the miner,
      who immediately closed with him. Mignon screamed, and ran to stop them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, for why you do&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, he got licked. I lost money on him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and you haven't paid me, neither. You shell out, you Buckeye Pete!"
      spoke up a tall Kentuckian, with a mastiff on a leash.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't a fair fight, Spotty Collins," whined Buckeye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was&mdash;it was, so!" called a chorus of voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll buy your dog," said Anthony. "That will pay your debts." Anthony
      handed the money to Collins, picked up the half dead dog, and, holding him
      against his immaculate new frilled shirt, he strode away toward his claim
      over the mountain. The jack, whose attitude had hair, never changed by so
      much as the waving of a suddenly raised an alert head and as his
      benefactor vanished, he ambled quickly after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete sought to stop him at the door and in one lightning and concerted
      movement, he bit and struck and kicked, scattering the crowd in all
      directions. When the men watching Anthony down the street, burst into
      laughter at the bizarre procession, the French girl silenced them with
      fierce, hissing syllables..
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heh! Dude Anthony, beloved of the b&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Zose words you shall not call la petite hound an' me. Even name of a dog
      is for such as you too good to be call'. Monsieur, we take pleasaire in
      your departure from hence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, please the lady, Buckeye. There's no other jackass to keep you
      here any longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Buckeye departed in a perfect indigo haze of profanity.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "Mignon, have you heard the news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Non, Monsieur, I 'ave sleep all ze day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spotty Collins was found in Blue Ravine this morning, robbed and
      murdered. You see, he had a lot of money on him from the dog fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But ze beeg hound?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was shot, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ze murderer, zey 'ave caught?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet. They say the sheriff's on his trail, though. He just got back
      from Sacramento and he went right out. By jinks, he's coming now! An' he's
      got 'im!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mon Dieu! It is Monsieur Ant'ony!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oui! Heem, my woman's heart knows well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By jinks, you must be right! There's the fightin' jack followin' the
      horses. Dude Anthony of all people!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not true! It cannot be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think I've got my man, boys. His clothes are covered with blood and the
      money was in his cabin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just made a strike in my claim. That is my own money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course, but the court thinks you oughtn't to keep it too long!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The 'court' is in his cups. He's sittin' over there in the plaza with his
      back against the flag pole, an' he won't budge. You listen&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Judge, can I see you to your room for a few hours' sleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?" asked the judge, eyeing the questioner solemnly. "Is there
      anything in the statutes of the State of California which forbids my
      pre-empting this small space on the highway? Is there any reason, if I am
      so inclined, that I should not teach my fellow-citizens the great moral
      lesson of the overthrow and debasement of genius by the demon rum? Am I
      not better employed than if in a stifling, tobacco-perfumed courtroom,
      beating law into the thick skull of a lawyer, who doesn't know Blackstone
      from white quartz? But, if you have four bits on you, and should ask me to
      join you&mdash;Ah, you have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the sheriff to Anthony, after they had vanished into a near
      bar, "I'll have to put you in the jug till court convenes."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Buckeye Pete was celebrating. He seemed to be suddenly flush with "dust"
      and was dispensing drinks with a liberality which soon brought him a
      numerous following. By midnight it was a well-mellowed assemblage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mignon, how long have you been dealin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About tree, four mont', Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean here. I mean altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About six ye-ar, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be well off by this time. An' they say that you've earned it all
      workin', and that you're straight. Say, I'll marry you, if you say the
      word&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say, they say, too much, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here! Don't you go givin' me no orders, you French crinoline fluff!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ordair no man, an' no man is ordair me!" She stared him down with her
      glittering, black eyes, and returned to her dealing. Pete strolled out,
      followed by his satellites. When the noises in the street grew louder it
      caused no particular comment. It was the usual thing. But when a crowd
      burst into the Royal Flush, Mignon sprang to her feet with a cry of
      anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dealt me a raw deal, didn't yeh, you smart Frenchie?" gloated Buckeye
      Pete. "Well, look at your man. Take a good look, an' don't miss the
      necktie he's wearin'. Pretty li'l rope choker we got for Dandy Anthony.
      Ain't no man can go killin' an' get away with it, while I'm here," looking
      around for applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Name of a pig!" hissed Mignon. "You&mdash;you would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure' we would! Right out on the lynchin' tree." She turned and dashed
      for the rear. "Ze sheriff! He must come toute suite!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Min," whispered Soft-soap Joe, the bartender, "he left two hours ago on a
      new case, otherwise they wouldn't a-dared do this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mon Dieu! An' ze justice, he is intoxicate! Mother Marie, pray for him,"
      she cried, in her own language, and she ran after the lynching party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once she stopped, shaking with terror at what she took to be a grizzly in
      the path. It was only the fighting donkey still following the master whom
      he had adopted. He made his way to the very center of the mob. The French
      girl followed and, climbing onto a barrel, faced the crowd with flashing
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Consider what you do! The judgment of le bon Dieu will be upon you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw! Choke her off! Pull her down, somebody."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the three or four who tried to reach Mignon on her barrel next to the
      bound man on the horse beneath the hanging tree, fell victim to the
      "greatest battling jack in the state."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend," orated the old judge afterwards, in describing these events,
      "what mere man, however filled with tanglefoot, could face the wicked
      teeth, and hoofs, and kicks which had conquered wild Texas bulls, caused
      the mountain lion to cringe in his lair, and the invincible grizzly to
      flee across the Sierras?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, the little donkey was everywhere at once, biting, striking,
      kicking, squealing, with the venom and speed and precision of a
      rattlesnake, while Mignon railed, unmindful of Anthony's protests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ze blood on hees clothes! Bah! You 'ave all see 'ow he is carry home la
      petite so-hurt dog. Oui! ze dog of Monsieur Pete. Who is know where
      Monsieur Collins is go for new dog fight? Monsieur Pete! Who has anger at
      Monsieur Ant'ony for because I, Mignon, 'ave look once again at Monsieur,
      who is so kind to all who I ave pain? Monsieur Pete! Who is insult good
      girl? That's me. Monsieur Pete! Who is spend much money tonight, who
      yesterday was br-r-oke? Monsieur Pete! Who, zen, should you swing on ze
      rope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited. There was absolute silence save for the crackle of the flaming
      pine-pitch torches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ver' well," in a low voice. "I, me, Mignon, shall answer." Again she
      paused. A long way down the canyon she heard horses galloping on the hard
      road. "Monsieur Pete!" she screamed, at the top of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mob struggled forward, yelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ver' well!" she cried, snatching a silver-mounted pistol out of her
      bosom. "Come on! Ze jackass, he is ke-e-ll five! I, Mignon, I ke-e-ll
      five! Ten shall go to le diable before mon brave shall hang!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They hesitated, those in front pressing back from the certain death which
      awaited them. Mignon set her arms akimbo, the gun gleaming at her hip, and
      taunted them in contemptuous French.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horsemen had reached the camp and soon thundered into view. "What's
      this going on, anyway?" demanded the sheriff, angrily. "Anthony Barstow is
      innocent. These men can prove that they spent the night at Barstow's
      cabin. When I learned the truth, I came straight back. Buckeye Pete, you
      throw up your hands! You're wanted for the murder of Spotty Collins."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mignon tore the noose from Anthony's neck, laughing and crying in true
      French abandon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anthony, you're snared in another kind of noose," laughed the sheriff. "I
      know you're need in' your arms, but that rip-snortin' little jack won't
      let me get near enough to cut your bonds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Salsifer!" he said, later on, "I'll have to swear that fighting jack
      in as a deputy sheriff, and set him to watchin' road agents confined in
      the jail. Well, goodnight, all. Pete's locked up safe and sound."
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later a sober band of grim spectres returned to the jail,
      overpowered the guard, and, for the second time that night, took out
      grisly fruit to hang on the lynching tree. There were no pine knots and no
      attempts at conversation till the leader asked: "Buckeye Pete, have you
      anything to say before you join your Maker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't no use prayin' for yourself," spoke up another voice. "Better pray
      for the soul of the man you sent to Purgatory, and for the well-bein' of
      the other innocent man you tried to destroy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's that fightin' jack, prowlin' 'round."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let 'im prowl! Now, then, boys, are you ready? Then pull!" and, as the
      old judge always told in conclusion, "they say, as the men gave a mighty
      heave on the rope the donkey ran forward and kicked the barrel from under
      the doomed man's feet!"
    </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
